0,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,The Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"The Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan): Good connectivity bolsters Singapore's vibrant economy. It creates good jobs for Singaporeans and raises their quality of life. The Ministry of Transport will further enhance our transport network to connect Singaporeans to destinations island-wide and around the world, to make Singapore our best home."
1,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"Our aviation and maritime sectors are the lifelines of Singapore’s economy. They position Singapore as a global city at the heart of international business, trade, and investment. Together, they contribute more than 10% of our GDP and 250,000 jobs."
2,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"We cannot take this for granted. Many in the region are working hard to replace us, with shipping and flight routes bypassing Singapore."
3,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"To anchor Singapore as a world-class air hub and International Maritime Centre, we are investing in the Changi Airport expansion and the next generation Tuas Port. This will strengthen our edge to seize new opportunities and capture greater growth for Singapore."
4,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"We are building new connections with our nearest neighbour, Malaysia. The Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail and Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link will open opportunities for work and play, and give both countries a greater stake in each other’s success."
5,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"Within Singapore, we continue to enhance public transport and active mobility, so that Singaporeans can enjoy many choices for work and play."
6,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"By 2030, we will expand our rail network by 130km. Construction of the Thomson-East Coast Line is underway. This will be followed by the Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line. We are on track to bring eight in ten households within a 10-minute walk from a train station by 2030. In parallel, we will develop a workforce of capable engineers and skilled technicians."
7,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"Rail reliability is a key priority, as we make steady progress towards our MKBF (Mean Kilometres Between Failure) target of 1,000,000 train-km by 2020. We will continue to accelerate asset renewal, and intensify maintenance of our older lines through extended engineering hours."
8,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"To advance active mobility, all HDB towns will have cycling networks and good bike parking facilities by 2030. We will introduce a licensing framework for bicycle sharing operators and registration for e-scooters by end-2018. This will enhance enforcement against indiscriminate parking and reckless riding, and instil a more responsible user culture."
9,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"We are reviewing the regulatory framework to license the private hire car (PHC) industry. We aim to keep the PHC and taxi industries open and contestable, and protect the interests of commuters and drivers."
10,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"As developments in autonomous vehicle (AV) and on-demand transport options gather pace, we will harness these technologies to provide convenient first-last mile commutes."
11,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"To create a cleaner and greener environment, we have launched Singapore’s first large-scale electric car sharing service, which aims to deploy up to 1,000 electric cars and 2,000 charge points by 2020. We will also deploy for trial 50 diesel-hybrid buses by 2019 and 60 electric buses by 2020."
12,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"As we rely less on cars, precious space will be freed up for other uses that will raise the quality of life for all Singaporeans."
13,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"We will further digitalise services and make them more user-friendly to individuals and businesses. To bring greater convenience to businesses, we will put port documentation requirements onto a single portal, and centralise applications for aviation safety approvals."
14,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"We will leverage technology to enhance transport operations. We are using data analytics to pre-empt faults in the rail network and improve rail reliability. We will also use predictive analytics, machine learning, and other data tools to enhance air and vessel traffic management, and improve safety and efficiency."
15,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"We will facilitate experimentation and promote innovation. The Living Labs at our airport and sea port enable technology providers and industry partners to co-develop innovations in a real operating environment. The One-North test bed facilitates the testing and development of AVs, Unmanned Aircraft Systems, and related technologies. A scheme has been launched to support start-ups to translate new ideas into marketable solutions. And we will share more transport data to foster the co-creation of data-driven innovations."
16,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"We will provide all Singaporeans good transport connectivity, regardless of their mobility needs. Today, all MRT stations and bus interchanges have barrier-free access. We will make all public buses wheelchair accessible by 2020. By 2023, we will have 50 Silver Zones and triple the number of pedestrian overhead bridges with lifts."
17,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"We are working with industry partners to develop assistive technologies for commuters with special needs, such as the Assistive Passenger Information System for the visual and hearing impaired. The Family-Friendly Advisory Panel is engaging diverse commuter groups to understand their mobility needs, such as families with young children."
18,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"We will work closely with our tripartite partners and education institutions, to re-skill and build deep expertise within the transport workforce. Through the air, sea, and land transport Industry Transformation Maps, we will create more than 21,000 new jobs by 2030. There will be many exciting career prospects for Singaporeans, and growth opportunities for Singapore companies."
19,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,,"In 2019, we will mark 200 years since Sir Stamford Raffles landed on our shores. Our strategic geographical location on the trade route between East and West helped transform Singapore from a sleepy fishing village to a modern metropolis. Connectivity continues to be paramount. Our drive towards being a Smart Nation will better connect the way we live, work, and play so that productivity can grow and innovation can flourish. The work of the Future Economy Council will also strengthen our physical, digital, financial, and trade connections to the rest of the world to ensure our relevance. MOT will play its part in supporting these key initiatives to build a better and brighter future for Singapore and Singaporeans."
