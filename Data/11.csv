0,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,Debate resumed.
1,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mrs Josephine Teo:Thank you, Mr Speaker."
2,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In Singapore’s case, I believe the latter is better able to serve our interests and I hope members can support this view. Mr Speaker, with your permission, I would like to give my concluding remarks in Mandarin."
3,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"(In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.]  Singapore is an international hub and a multi-racial and multi-religious society. We have a good reputation, the society is stable and people generally feel safe."
4,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Because of these attributes, we are a prized target for terrorists. Being able to successfully attack Singapore will give terrorists significant advantage in advancing their cause and reputation, and it will be a major victory for the terrorists."
5,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In other cities, we have seen the impact of terrorist attacks on the public. We studied their security responses carefully. We concluded that our laws need to be strengthened."
6,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"POSSPA will give our security forces the necessary powers to respond effectively to serious incidence which threaten public safety, such as terrorist attacks, and protect our people."
7,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"(In English): Mr Speaker, we did not introduce this Bill in a vacuum. We did so only after studying the terrorist attacks that had taken place in other countries, and the limitations and problems they faced in dealing with the attacks. At the same time, in requesting for the special powers in the Bill, we have put in place safeguards."
8,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"But even as we debate the extent of the special powers, let us remember that we will never really know whether our preparations go far enough, until they are put to the test in an actual incident."
9,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The bottom line is this: it is up to us to safeguard Singaporeans and Singapore if and when we come under a terror attack. In this, we must not fail. Mr Speaker, I beg to move."
10,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,Question proposed.
11,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill because it provides our Police with the necessary powers to respond effectively to specific situations, in particular, terror attacks."
12,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Terror attacks follow the same game play of division, terror, pandemonium. But terror attacks have ranged in form, such as, lone wolf attacks, for example, knife attacks against a church in Yogyakarta, Indonesia; to coordinated firearm attacks, for example, the bombing in Paris in November 2015; or the tactic of long besiegement, for example, in Marawi, Philippines, or a quick, single attack through commonplace items, for example, the vehicle rampage in Berlin's Christmas market; or highly symbolic, high impact attacks, for example, the collapse of the Twin Towers, or insidious attacks against innocent children such as the bombing at Ariana Grande concert."
13,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"As terrorists' methods change and vary widely, we too in Singapore need to ensure our laws keep abreast to deal with their widening and changing modus operandi."
14,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The basis of the expanded powers are acts of serious violence affecting the public, acts causing large scale public disorder, and terror attacks. These have been carefully defined under clauses 3 and 4. While such expanded powers are completely ill-suited for a neighbourhood theft incident, for example, the standard powers are also ill-suited for dealing with such large-scale public order and public safety events."
15,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"For example, under clause 19 read with clause 15(4)(a), the Police are able to rope in civilians to help to cordon off roads. This would be extremely useful, for example, where there is a large area to secure – back-up is not there yet, and time is of the essence in preventing the perpetrator from escaping or other members of the public from entering."
16,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Another example is the power to remove parked vehicles under clause 24 on the basis of endangering others, obstructing traffic flow and hindering the exercise of special powers. Imagine what would happen if a single vehicle held up the back-up Police forces, or if a vehicle was lying around as a getaway car, also doubling up as an obstruction to Police forces."
17,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Another example is the power under clause 27 to direct premises owners to cooperate by providing information about the premises, closing the premises for a specific time, and ensuring the entrances and exits are secured. Take, for example, a situation where the perpetrator is still at large in the area. Surely, we do not want more people walking into the ""minefield"". And, surely, having access to floor plans is going to be extremely helpful for strategising where and how operations may be carried out."
18,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Therefore, this Bill provides powers to deal with large-scale public disorder and serious violence incidents, which are largely different from normal day-to-day scenarios."
19,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Additionally, this Bill is specifically targeted towards ensuring the Police can effectively respond to the situation. This can be seen in how the applicability of the expanded powers in this Bill are triggered by the Police Commissioner, that the purpose of the power is meant to enhance Police effectiveness, is a recurrent theme throughout the Bill presented today in Parliament."
20,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Therefore, although it is predicated on the Minister's issuance of an ""activation order"", which powers are to be exercised and by whom, are decisions for the Police Commissioner to make. This is done, not by the Minister, but by the Police Commissioner separately issuing temporary restraining orders, communication stop orders and requisition powers as well as the ""special authorisation"" under clause 11."
21,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Importantly, the current Bill is not without safeguards, as alluded to by the good Minister. It is not a rough expansion of powers across the board, carte blanche. Rather, clause 15 carefully calibrates according to the person exercising the power. For instance, while Police are able to enforce curfew orders, serviceman cannot."
22,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Furthermore, other counter-measures in the Bill, such as curfews, communication stop orders, discontinuation of telecommunication service, requisition powers, do not apply across the board. They require yet another order by the Commissioner or Minister on top of the more general conferring of broader powers. This calibrated approach makes sure that the measures are flexible enough to be effective in different situations, in different scenarios."
23,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"An activation order or a mere special authorisation is not a free pass to all the rest of the counter-measure powers. They require additional orders by the Minister or Commissioner, only arising when the situation calls for it and may apply for a shorter time period. We are not treating it as a one-size-fits-all authorisation, but we are ensuring that there is enough mechanisms to address serious incidents effectively."
24,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Another important restriction that embeds accountability into the exercise of power is the explicit lists of acceptable purposes of the use of the power. Take, for example, the communications stop order in clause 30. In a ""serious incident"" like that in illustration (d) of a large sit-down demonstration impeding traffic and interfering with normal business activities, it seems a communication stop order is not to be issued to quell publicity."
25,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Rather, it appears that it can only be issued if it is in the Police Commissioner's opinion that it would endanger safety of the public, prejudices on-going law enforcement activity and other purposes set out in clause 30(2)(b)."
26,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Sir, zeroing into the communication stop order, I support the idea behind it. Too many hostage rescues, counter-terror attacks have been compromised through social media broadcasting, live media broadcasting. Perpetrators at the Taj and Oberoi hotels in Mumbai in 2008 were able to view and monitor actions of security forces through TV coverage."
27,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The power to take down drones in the target area should be considered. The bottom line is this – once a theatre of threat has been established, we should remove all disadvantages to the Police. That will help to quell the threat and neutralise the danger."
28,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"This restriction on communication protects the people being rescued by increasing the chances of a successful rescue. It also protects the people who are trying to rescue them. After all, they too have families and friends waiting for their safe return."
29,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Even as important as it is to control the physical situation, it is also important for the right foundations to be laid for social resilience. If there is a vacuum of information, there may be a lack of confidence that the situation is being managed. Because this may be for some time, perhaps one month, according to clause 10(2), inaccurate rumours may run amok through lack of accurate information. As the days pass, hope may dwindle. Therefore, would the Minister kindly clarify whether the communication stop order prevents a person from passing on official updates on an on-going incident so as to quell anxiety amongst the families of those affected?"
30,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Another counter-measure that may be utilised is the power of requisition under clause 35. One can imagine that in a densely built-up urban area such as Singapore, this power may be especially important for launching an effective surprise attack on the target person."
31,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The Bill also provides for additional offences that seek to ensure that the situation in the target area does not escalate further. For instance, clause 37, relating to provoking breach of peace. These offences are predicated on the activation order. Therefore, I would like to seek an elaboration on what, I quote, ""all reasonable steps"" that must be taken by management or an officer of a company to absolve liability under clause 45(2)(b) are. Essentially, what are ""all reasonable steps""?"
32,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"While ""reasonable steps"" have been defined under clause 46(6) through the ""standard provision"" relating to corporate crimes as stated in the Explanatory Statement, what would it look like for a company to do all reasonable steps to promote a culture, something that is built overtime, that does not encourage, tolerate or lead to noncompliance of the offences when the offences under this Bill only arise under the special circumstances of an activation order? What then? I hope the Minister will be able to clarify."
33,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"From a macro perspective, Mr Speaker, this Bill confers powers necessary to effectively deal with large-scale public order, public safety threats. It comes with an underlying tension, and I accept that. On the one hand, we do not want to face a situation where the Police is unable to neutralise the danger and quell the disorder because they lack the necessary powers. And, on the other hand, there may be sentiment that the Police should not be given disproportionate powers. In my view, the way I deal with this tension is that I do not think the Police are being given disproportionate powers here. In my view, this Bill equips the Police with a level of power necessary to quell danger and neutralise an escalating threat."
34,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The foundation of my argument is that we have a good Police force and, largely, enforce their powers professionally. And my core position is this: we do not want the Police to be unprepared, left inadequately protected, because the Police officers are bereft of what they need to quell a threat. I support this Bill for it is needed to protect Singapore and Singaporeans."
35,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied):Mr Speaker, Sir, in its media release of 27 February 2018, MHA stated categorically that the Special Powers under this Bill would not be available for routine operations. Two weeks later, on 15 March, MHA repeated that the Bill would not apply to day-to-day policing. This second statement was made in response to concerns from civil society groups about the wide wording of the Bill. Today, the Minister has just repeated the assurance in her Second Reading speech when she said she hoped that the Special Powers would never need to be used."
36,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Sir, the understanding that the Bill should only be invoked in exceptional circumstances is a critical underlying assumption for the debate on this Bill. Parliament is being asked to approve very draconian powers to be given to law enforcement and supporting forces, but only in situations where there is an imminent and grave danger to the safety and security of people in Singapore. As MHA has stated, the threshold for special powers to be activated in the Bill is ""high"". The powers under this Bill must never be misused for situations that can be adequately dealt with under other laws."
37,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"This Bill serves to repeal the Public Order (Preservation) Act (or POPA) enacted in 1958, but its aims are wider. While the long title of POPA states that the Act relates to the maintenance and restoration of public order, this Bill states that its aim is to ""extend Police powers to better prevent and respond to any incident or likely incident involving serious violence or large-scale public disorder in Singapore""."
38,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Thus, this Bill envisages prevention and response, not just to public disorder, but serious violence as well. To this end, the Bill provides some new powers not contained in POPA, such as the ability of Police to direct owners of buildings within incident areas to take actions like closing the building for a specified time, and for Police to question individuals within a target area when conducting a manhunt."
39,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Sir, I accept that the nature of the threats that Singapore faces today, especially from terrorism, is different from the problems that POPA was supposed to address when it was enacted in 1958. The Government would need muscle as well as flexibility to respond quickly and effectively to those threats. I believe Singaporeans want this."
40,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Under the Bill, the Minister can issue an Activation Order under clause 8 if he is of the opinion that a serious incident has occurred, is occurring or is threatened, and that the use of the Special Powers under the Bill would be necessary to achieve the objectives of preventing the occurrence, reducing its impact, or controlling and restoring public order. According to clause 9, the Minister's Activation Order must specify the nature of the serious incident, the duration of the Activation Order, and authorise the Commissioner of Police to exercise all or any of the Special Powers under the Bill."
41,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"It seems to me that the principle of proportionality should be a cardinal principle in exercising all the powers under the Bill. Not only must the Minister’s threshold for issuing an Activation Order be high, the decision of which Special Powers are really needed to deal with a particular scenario should be deliberately considered case by case. Earlier during the Second Minister's Second Reading speech, she confirmed that for each incident, the Commissioner of Police would consider the need for each Special Power as commensurate with the nature of the incident."
42,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"What should also concern us today is whether any of the provisions in the Bill seem to be too wide, or involve too much of a compromise on competing public interests such as public accountability. In this regard, I have two concerns to raise."
43,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"First, the definition of ""serious incident"" under clause 3 of the Bill. Clause 3 defines ""serious incident"" to include not only terrorism-related offences and acts of serious violence, but also acts ""causing large-scale public disorder"". There are five factual illustrations for the scope of clause 3. The first three scenarios concern the use of explosives and firearms, and the forcible taking over of public transport, which to most of us warrant an exceptional response from the authorities. However, the last two illustrations which concern public disorder are more controversial. Illustration (d) covers a sit-down peaceful protest that grows in size such that there is impediment to paths, roads and normal business. Illustration (e) is about a group protesting in the street that grows in size and then starts to commit violent acts, which sounds to me like rioting, which is an arrestable offence under the Penal Code."
44,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"I would like Minister to explain why the existing laws are not adequate to deal with such scenarios as in illustrations (d) and (e). In addition, it seems to me that in these scenarios, any law enforcement operation would not be tactically sensitive to warrant the use of Special Powers such as the Communications Stop Order (CSO), a topic I shall deal with next."
45,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Sir, notwithstanding what the Second Minister has said about the CSO, I am still most concerned about clauses 30 and 31. It is stated that the Commissioner of Police can issue a CSO to ban the making of relevant films or pictures, and to ban exhibiting or communicating any relevant film or picture, or a relevant text or audio message. The Commissioner can issue a CSO if he is of the view that exhibiting or communicating such relevant pictures, films, texts or audio messages would prejudice on-going law enforcement operations relating to serious incidents, or endanger the safety of the public or law enforcement officers during the law enforcement activity. The terms ""relevant picture or film"", and ""relevant text or audio message"", are defined in clause 2, broadly to mean those made while the Special Powers are activated and which are related to the target area or law enforcement activities in the target area."
46,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Under clause 31, a police officer can direct persons to stop making, exhibiting or communicating such relevant films, pictures, texts or audio messages. Police can also compel the deletion and the surrender of such material, and require persons to provide information on the recipients of any communications."
47,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Sir, I appreciate fully that when a tactical security operation is on-going, the details of a target area and the deployment of law enforcement require secrecy for maximum efficacy. Past incidents such as the Mumbai attack in 2008 have shown that TV footage of on-going operations had given perpetrators live information on the presence and tactics of law enforcement, enabling them to anticipate the actions of law enforcement forces."
48,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"However, on the other hand, it has also been proven in past incidents that footage or photographs taken at the scene of major incidents prevented fake news and enabled the truth to emerge, after the incidents were over. For instance, in 2009, a G-20 summit meeting was held in London and a police operation codenamed ""Operation Glencoe"" was mounted to manage protestors. While the operation was on, a man named Ian Tomlinson suddenly fell and died while in the vicinity. Police initially denied that they had any altercation with him, until a video taken by an American there on business, showed Mr Tomlinson being pushed to the ground by police. This led to inquiries that uncovered the truth, which would not have happened had contemporaneous videos not been recorded."
49,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Sir, while I can accept that the transmission of relevant films, pictures, texts and audio messages during a tactical operation may jeopardise the effectiveness of the operations, I do not accept that the making and the storing of such films and pictures for later viewing will undermine such operations."
50,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Sir, as regards how such films and pictures can guard against police abuse, MHA stated on the 15 March that this was not required, as the police would always look into any feedback or complaint about misconduct of its officers seriously. However, the reality is that in any investigation, evidence talks. If it is a case of ""he-says-she-says"", the burden will fall on the complainant to prove the complaint. A ban on making relevant films and pictures does not promote fact-finding and accountability."
51,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"I note what the Second Minister had said earlier in her Second Reading speech about the operational difficulties that the Police may face on the ground to distinguish between who is simply just making a film for record, or who is contemporaneously transmitting the films. As a former Police officer, I understand that difficulty fully. Nevertheless, even if the offence of making films needs to be on the books in the Government's assessment, I would hope that the Government would be slow to prosecute if the film or picture adds value to post-review investigations."
52,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"So, Sir, in summary, I still have my concerns about the compromise we are making in the CSOs and I would ask the Government to adopt a more constructive approach towards unofficial recordings of major incidents."
53,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member):Mr Speaker, today we are discussing this proposed Bill, which will repeal the Public Order (Preservation) Act, and this Bill increases the powers of the Police so that they can better deal with large-scale security threats that we may face in Singapore. These powers will include stop and search powers, requisitioning powers, powers to set up and enforce cordons and curfews."
54,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"While I recognise that in emergency situations, there is a need for the authorities to act swiftly and given some latitude in exercising their powers, we must nonetheless ensure that such security measures remain accountable and be accorded with due process and fairness so as to ensure that public confidence with the Government does not erode during crisis time."
55,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Before I turn to discuss the substance of the Bill, I would like to understand if there was a public consultation for this Bill. I believe the public has a right to have their views heard on this Bill before its enactment given that this Bill is a matter of public interest because it has wide-ranging implications and would intimately affect the public during emergency situations."
56,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, there are some measures in the Bill which after my consultations with civil society, that I would now want to discuss."
57,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"One of the concerns that I have was the definition of what constitute a ""serious incident"". I would like to bring your attention to Illustration (d) under clause 3 which relates to a sit down demonstration in CBD area which grows to a point, over a week, that it impedes the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic and interfere with business activities. So, what in this illustration would make it a ""serious"" enough incident, such that it could be comparable to the other illustrations such as illustrations (a) and (b), both depicting possible terrorist attacks? Illustration (d) is a peaceful protest involving neither violence against any person or property damage and presumably attracting a substantial level of support. While such events may require some Police intervention because of some degree of disorderliness, but they are not comparable to armed attacks or hostage situations in terms of severity."
58,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"To me, illustration (d) seems to stand in stark contrast to all the other illustrations provided as the level of severity and the threat posed is significantly lower."
59,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Can the Second Minister share with the House why she thinks that the powers under the Criminal Procedure Code or the Public Order might be insufficient to cover illustration (d) situation and therefore it is necessary to include this illustration as an example of the ""serious incident"" under clause 3?"
60,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Another area of concern that I have with the Bill is that it enlists the help of civilian assistants to discharge certain duties. Under clause 2 of the Bill, specific powers are given to civilian assistants to assist a police officer who is granted the special authorisation. Further, under clause 15(4)(a), a civilian assistant is authorised to exercise certain powers."
61,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, civilian assistants are not subject to the same training afforded to a serviceman, law enforcement officer or police officer. Therefore, in emergency situations that require instant decision-making under pressure, there is a possibility that civilian assistants might not possess the ability to respond quickly, decisively and even correctly as a trained personnel would. Additionally, civilian assistants may exacerbate the emergency situation or inadvertently cause harm to themselves or by-standers while discharging their duties."
62,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"As such, my concern is that enlisting of the assistance of civilian assistants might be more detrimental than beneficial during crisis period and that the safety of these assistants might be compromised in the process of discharging their duties."
63,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,I would therefore like to understand how the Ministry will ensure that the safety of these assistants are protected when they discharge their duties.
64,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Sir, my third area of concern is with the broad discretion given to the Minister to grant an Activation Order. Under clause 8 of the Bill, if in the opinion of the Minister, the granting of the Activation Order is necessary to prevent or reduce the impact of the serious incident or to control or maintain public order after the serious incident, my question is, what does the term ""necessary"" entail?"
65,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"I would also note that the decision of the Minister does not require approval from another arm of the Government or an independent body. This is in contrast to section 3(5) of the Public Order (Preservation) Act which this Bill seeks to replace, every proclamation of a dangerous area must be presented to Parliament for their concurrence."
66,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Comparatively, under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act and the Internal Security Act, both of which are security-natured acts, the decisions of the Minister are subject to the concurrence by the President on the advice of a special advisory committee. Just now in Second Minister's Second Reading speech, she has articulated the reason why she felt this should be removed. While I understand the time sensitivity of the Special Order, however, I also note the Second Minister has also said, this is such a special situation that she would even wish that it would not be ever activated. I think amechanism of accountability should have been there. It can be done as soon as possible, without impeding the expediency of the police when they are exercising this Order."
67,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Further, under clause 8(3), an Activation Order must be published but a failure to publish does not invalidate the Order. Mr Speaker, I believe the two clauses are contradictory in nature. If it is a must to publish an Activation Order, logic dictates that the failure to publish the Order will invalidate it. I would like to understand the reasons behind this provision that the failure to publish does not invalidate the Order. Moreover, if there is an incident where an Order is not published and a police officer uses his special powers on an individual who does not know that this Order has been there, and subsequently refuses to obey the instructions of the police officer, is such an individual guilty of an offence under the Act?"
68,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Such a failure to publish means that the public may be uninformed. How can someone be held liable for a sudden change they have not been reasonably notified about? Additionally, if there is a situation when there is a failure to publish such a notice, should there not be a system of accountability of why the failure happened?"
69,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Now, I would like to discuss the next area of concern which pertains to clauses 30 and 31 which gives the Commissioner the power to make Communications Stop Orders against individuals."
70,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In the MHA’s Press Release on 27 February 2018, the Ministry explained that such a Communications Stop Order is necessary to prevent leakage of such information to terrorist which could endanger the lives of security officers and members of the public who are caught in the act. The Ministry cited two examples: that of the Mumbai and Paris attacks whereby live television and media broadcast during those attacks resulted in leakage of information to the terrorists. In turn, such leakage of information made the police operation more difficult and placed the safety of the officers and hostages at greater risk."
71,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In both incidents, it was not individual communications between persons or through the social media that impeded security operations, but rather through the live reporting of the said incidents by the media. Yet, there is an absence of guidelines or provision in this Bill that regulate or prevent the traditional media from leaking information through live broadcast that may impede security operations, which appears to be the mischief that a Communications Stop Order seeks to address."
72,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"There might also be issues arising from the issuance of Communication Stops Orders against individuals. Under clause 30(1)(b), the exhibiting and communicating by any person of a relevant text may be banned during the period which the communication stop order is in force. If individuals near the vicinity are trying to inform their loved ones of their safety or to warn their loved ones to avoid the area of the serious incident, how are such individuals able to do so?"
73,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Also, what if an individual takes a photo or a video of an abuse of power by police officers, under clause 31(20(b), the police officer can order that individual to delete that video or photo. How is that individual then going to report to the Ministry when the only evidence to substantiate that claim has been deleted? Can the Minister please clarify what will be done in such situation?"
74,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In the event when ""serious incidents"" like terrorists attacks, there will be a lot of confusion and emotion will run high. In fact, the impact of any of such security incidents is not just about fatalities and loss of properties but it will cause fear and distress and then de-stabilise, paralyse and even divide the society. In the aftermath of such an event, it is important that there are enough information for us to piece things together, to verify facts, to dismiss accusations and restore justice if need be."
75,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Hence, in these moments of high tension when people think that it is important to document certain happenings so that it could be useful in the aftermath of the event, to help police to understand the situations better, this Communications Stop Order should not deter the individuals from doing that. In fact, documentation is important in the event of allegations of whether the police or the public have stepped out of their line. It is a means to protect police officers and public from false accusations and these documentations are witnesses and testimonies, and in the aftermath of the event, can help a lot in the healing of the community."
76,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"I have one more query pertaining to this: what if when a police officer was accused of abuse of process, by an individual, who has documented the incident, during the effect of the communication stop order, could prove that the Police was innocent, would this individual who surrenders the documentation then be charged?"
77,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Another operational issue that I have is with the power of the Minister to give directions to telecommunication licensees to, amongst others, stop messages carried by a telecommunication service provided by the licensee under clause 32(3) (a) or prohibit the use of telecommunications by the licensee when an activation order is in effect. In the event that the telecommunication messaging and telecommunications services are discontinued, how would individuals caught in the vicinity where the serious incident occurred be able to send out messages of distress or call for help?"
78,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"My final area of concern pertains to clause 38 of the Bill which criminalises, amongst others, the publication of materials prejudicial to the public order."
79,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Firstly, Mr Speaker, can the Minister clarify why the mere possession of a document is criminalised under clause 38? If for instance, an individual types something on his phone, or writes something with no intention to publish it and merely for personal use, it seems disproportionate to say that such a person is liable of an offence especially when no potential harm is caused by a mere possession?"
80,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Secondly, what constitutes prejudicial material or documents appears to be too broadly defined such that a material that might not actually be prejudicial to public order and security may, nonetheless, be caught under clause 38. For instance, clause 38(1) (a) merely requires the said material to be “likely to be prejudicial”, as opposed to being “highly likely to be prejudicial”."
81,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Thirdly, clause 38(2) seems to displace the element of intention for an offence relating to publishing material prejudicial to public order. It is a trite criminal law principle under that an individual must have a guilty mind in addition to his or her action before one can be criminalised. Therefore, can the Minister provide reasons as to why clause 38(2) appears to deviate from these important principles?"
82,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Fourthly, Mr Speaker, I also note that in the interest of speed and efficiency, criminalising an individual under clause 38 may not necessarily be the most efficient measure to deal with materials that may be prejudicial to public order during an emergency situation. Would a takedown order that immediately forces an individual to stop distributing or take down any prejudicial matter be faster and more efficient in dealing with the publication of such material rather than criminalising the conduct?"
83,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, permit me to reiterate that I do not oppose the intention of the Bill. National security is a priority in the current global climate. However, my view is that the Bill affords too much discretion on decision makers. Therefore, more can be done in this respect to ensure greater transparency and accountability which is crucial during times of emergencies."
84,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar):Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill, which seeks to extend police powers to better prevent and respond to any incident involving serious violence or large-scale public disorder in Singapore."
85,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"As a former Police officer myself, I can understand and appreciate fully the challenges faced by our Police officers on the ground daily. Our Police officers place their lives at risk constantly, and this risk increases immensely in the event of an attack. While others are running away from the threat, our officers must run towards, and seek to diffuse the threat. In my view, the powers proposed in this Bill are necessary and timely. It will help our Police and other Home Team officers better carry out their job to save lives."
86,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, MHA’s Singapore Terrorism Threat Assessment Report 2017 found that terrorism threat to Singapore remains the highest in recent years. Singapore continues to be a prized target of regional and global terrorist organisations. Over the years, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have managed to act swiftly and discreetly to foil the attempts of foreign JI and ISIS militants in carrying out an attack in Singapore. But terrorism threats to our country are not confined to within our borders. In August 2016, the Indonesian authorities foiled a plot by a Batam-based terrorist group, which had intended to launch a rocket attack against the Marina Bay Sands, using Batam as a launch point."
87,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In recent years, we have also seen a rise in the number of self-radicalised individuals influenced by extremist ideologies to target Singapore. Clearly, the threat to Singapore has increased tremendously, and our legislation needs to evolve in tandem to combat these threats."
88,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Under the Bill, the Minister for Home Affairs is empowered to issue an Activation Order if a serious incident affecting public safety has occurred. Such an order must describe the general nature of the incident, specify the period or periods during which the activation order has effect, and authorise the Commissioner of Police to exercise the special powers under the provision of this Bill."
89,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The Commissioner of Police is given the flexibility to then decide the targets of special powers, depending on the evolving operational needs. I agree that this is important and time critical for the Police especially in the event of multiple attacks, such as the November 2015 attacks in Paris, which saw a series of coordinated terrorist attacks in multiple locations. However, who makes the operational call that these multiple incidents are connected?"
90,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In the May 2017 Manchester concert bombing, there was a separate security incident which prompted an evacuation of a shopping mall in Manchester. Some thought that it was a coordinated attack, but investigations later revealed that it was unrelated to the concert bombing. My question then is whether the subsequent incidents must have a nexus to the original incident, or should the Minister be required to issue a new Activation Order if the subsequent incidents are seemingly unrelated to the first incident? Who then makes the call if incidents are related or not to the first incident?"
91,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, the Bill also serves to empower the Police to issue a Communications Stop Order to prevent sensitive information from being disseminated, to the detriment of operations secrecy, as well as the safety of the public and police officers. I am supportive of this."
92,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Allow me to cite a few examples. In the manhunt for the Boston marathon bombers, ‘live’ reports showing key police operations helped the suspects to evade capture for about four days. In the Manila bus hostage incident, the ""live"" broadcast of impending police operations to storm the bus further agitated the hostage-taker, who executed several hostages before he was eventually taken down. Having a Communications Stop Order imposed in such scenarios would help protect operations secrecy, prevent critical information from leaking to the suspects via media, and more crucially prevent the loss of innocent lives."
93,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"However, it is a well-known fact that the initial 30 minutes after an incident occurs, is a key period where every information collected is vital for the authorities to make sense of what is happening. This is also why our Police has been advocating the concept of Run, Hide and Tell. Where possible, tell the Police as soon as you can on where you are and what is happening. How can we, in the event of a terrorist incident, strike a balance between Run, Hide, and Tell, with the imposition of a communications stop order?"
94,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Going back to the Boston Marathon bombing, the big breakthrough in identifying the suspects came from a photo taken by a spectator watching the race from across the street. We would need to make sure that any communications ban would not inadvertently end up harming police investigations."
95,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, Section 28 of the Bill empowers a police officer to direct persons operating unmanned aircrafts, or drones, and autonomous vehicles away from an area. However, to do so, the police officer is required to locate the person operating the drone or autonomous vehicle. Drone technology is advancing rapidly. Upcoming models will soon be able to operate beyond an operator’s visual line of sight. How would our police officers be able to find the drone operator if the drone in question is far away from the operator?"
96,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Similarly, autonomous vehicle technology is advancing towards a level of autonomy where a human will not be required to be in the car. How would the police officer direct an autonomous vehicle away in such an instance? These are questions that MHA would need to think about carefully, as technology advances."
97,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, due to the heightened terrorist threat, the additional powers in this Bill are essential for the Police. The Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Bill is an important part of the Government’s on-going counter terrorism efforts, coming after the Public Order (Amendment) Bill and the Infrastructure Protection Bill which were passed last year."
98,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The powers to protect the integrity of tactical operations will enable the Police to carry out their mission by choosing the best tactical options available, without having to worry that the terrorists can watch their actions ""live"", anticipate their actions, and ambush them around the next corner. The proposed amendments serve to ensure that our Police will not be caught without the powers they require to safeguard lives and property, when an attack occurs."
99,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Keeping us safe and secure every day is not an easy task and our Home Team has done, and continues to do an incredible job. Mr Speaker, I support the Bill."
100,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member):Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of this Bill. In view of the rising terrorism threats around the world, it is increasingly important to strengthen and tighten home security to ensure public order and safety. This is even more crucial for a small and multi-ethnic nation like Singapore."
101,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Last year, MHA had reported that the terrorism threat to Singapore remained the highest in recent years. Security is indeed a joint responsibility between individuals, community and the Government. I therefore welcome the SG Secure national movement as Singapore's community response to the threat of terror."
102,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In our workplaces, we have people of different races and nationalities working side by side. The news on ISIS and self-radicalised individuals may affect the cohesion of the various groups of people working and living amongst us."
103,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"When there is such incident of terror, the Bill will allow the Commissioner of Police to make a Communications Stop Order while security operations are on-going, therefore police powers are proposed to be expanded to deal with terror attacks and serious incidents. It is, therefore, important that our officers are trained adequately to face potential challenges and different situations."
104,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In addition, the measure of barring the public from taking images, ban text or audio messages from affected area is essential to ensure that no public disorder might arise due to misinformation. The Bill is also essential to protect the secrecy of tactical operations and enable police to respond to serious incidents more effectively."
105,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Sir, notwithstanding this, I have the following clarifications and suggestions to make."
106,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"First, what constitutes serious incident that provides the authorities with the special power to block all communication and filming and use of social media? Does this include non-violent passive protest or demonstration that has serious societal implication besides violent or terrorist incident?"
107,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Second, when the Commissioner of Police authorises a Communication Stop Order while security operations are on-going, it will require all people in the vicinity from not taking pictures of the incident or sending them across to others. In today’s context, almost all Singaporeans use a mobile phone to inform their loved ones of their safety. Can such harmless communication be allowed if an individual is within the vicinity of the serious incident?"
108,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"More often than not, public information via social media may provide useful leads for police investigation. With this Bill, public may be wary of producing such information to the police even if they had acquired them. While we want to prevent frivolous dissemination of vital information, there should be means to acquire such useful information from the public. We should encourage civil society’s active participation in deterring terrorism and serious incident with useful public information. Will the Bill discourage such responsive nature of public involvement to apprehend perpetrators?"
109,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,Will such special powers result in public fear of abuse of power by Police? How can one independently verify Police action when there is communication black out as the evidence presented is one-sided?
110,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Lastly, I seek the Ministry to create awareness of the new Bill. The public must know the serious implications as it is now deemed as an offence if one violates the order. While the public gets used to the new restriction, I hope that cases of genuine violation due to ignorance will be dealt minimally with discretionary powers. Sir, notwithstanding this, I support the Bill."
111,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon):Sir, like other Members in this House, I am in favour of providing the Police with enhanced powers to maintain public order and safety. We have to look to incidents around the world, to learn about the evolving methods that terrorists use to inflict maximum damage and terror. Even if these incidents have not occurred in Singapore, there is no guarantee that it will not happen here. And when they do, we need to be prepared for it."
112,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The POSSPA Bill is an important step to equip and empower our security agencies to mount an effective response, should we one day need it. While I support the Bill in its intentions, allow me to seek a few clarifications on its details."
113,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In clause 3, “serious incidents” are defined to constitute terrorist acts, acts of serious violence, acts causing large-scale public disorder, and so on. Members of this House, past and present, have continuously debated about striking the right balance between maintaining public order, and proportionate responses to achieving that order. We have constantly been recalibrating this balance, not just today, but in 2009 when we discussed the Public Order Act, and again in 2014 after the Little India Riots."
114,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In that light, can Minister clarify why “acts causing large-scale public disorder” under part (c) of clause 3 are defined as a “serious incident” on the same scale as violent acts of terrorism?"
115,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The Bill provides an example of such an act – describing “a sit-down demonstration ... (which) attracts a large group of sympathisers who voluntarily join the sit-in… Their presence starts to impede the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic”, which many other Members of this House have quoted as well."
116,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The Bill proposes that the Police be given the same set of powers, whether it is dealing with acts of terrorism, or sit-down demonstrations which attract a large group of sympathisers. Why?"
117,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"I do understand that there is a concern that these assemblies might lead to violence and injuries, but can Minister clarify what exactly is the “high threshold” for the activation of the special powers spelled out in the Bill? What will trigger the activation?"
118,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,I would also like to seek clarity on the size of an assembly that could qualify as a “large-scale public disorder”. When would a crowd be large enough for these special powers to be activated?
119,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"For some members of the public, it may also seem excessive, in these cases, to allow the Police enhanced powers to stop and question individuals within the incident areas, and if the individual does not comply, to issue a fine of up to $20,000 or two years’ imprisonment. Or in clauses 18, 19 and 20 – to use force, including lethal weapons to ensure compliance of orders."
120,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Again, members of the public are clearly supportive of the use of lethal weapons to ensure compliance of orders when there is a terrorist attack but the concern of some members of the public is whether we need to use such lethal powers for a sit-down demonstration? Can Minister address these concerns?"
121,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Next, I believe that the communications stop order in clause 30 is absolutely necessary in situations where ""live"" communications could give terrorists the upper hand. We do not want to see an embarrassing repeat of the Mumbai attacks in 2008, or the Manila hostage crisis in 2010."
122,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Related to my previous point, I would like to ask the rationale again for requiring such a stop order – again, for “acts causing large-scale public disorder”. Can Minister provide some clarifications on why this is needed?"
123,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"I understand that a member of the public would not be penalised if he/she was taking a photo and sending it to authorities via SG Secure. In any given situation, there could be many people using their phones concurrently for different reasons, some violating the Communications Stop Order and some not. How then would this be effectively policed?"
124,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Furthermore, I believe it would be beneficial to have more clarity on certain language used in the Bill. In clauses 18, 19, 20 and 48 the Police may “use force as is reasonably necessary”, “including the use of lethal weapons”. Can it be more clearly defined as to what constitutes reasonable force?"
125,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"While empowering the Police with necessary powers to maintain public order, we also need to balance this with safeguards to prevent the misuse of this power."
126,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The Bill now also grants some special powers to “civilian assistants”, which Members of this House has raised as well. which I understand was not previously included in the Public Order Preservation Act (POPA)."
127,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"How can we ensure that these civilian assistants are sufficiently trained, particularly to know what “reasonable force” entails?"
128,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Some members of the public are also concerned that with the Communications Stop Order in place, if there are any case of potential Police brutality were to occur, we would not have independent documentation of the event. This may lead to some question on whether there are sufficient safeguards to prevent a scenario of disproportionate power."
129,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"MHA has since clarified that if members of the public have any allegations of misconduct, or abuse of powers by police officers, when POSSPA has been activated, they should lodge a police report or report directly to the Ministry. But we will have to bear in mind that they may not be in possession of any evidence to support that Police report, due to the Communications Stop Order. Can the Minister provide more clarity on this issue?"
130,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Sir, I do understand the need and importance of this Bill and I hope that Minister can address the concerns I have raised. Sir notwithstanding the above clarifications, I stand in support of this Bill."
131,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong):Mr Speaker, Sir, recent serious terror attacks in Jakarta and Selangor have resulted in serious injuries and deaths. These underscore how the current Bill is timely, necessary and important, particularly since Singapore has been cited as a target in jihadist publications and videos, by both ISIS and other terrorist groups."
132,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Many other countries have similarly stepped up their counter-terrorism responses, such as the EU countries which have been victim to horrific attacks. Britain, for instance, under its Investigative Powers Act, is empowered to conduct mass surveillance."
133,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"While we agree that the Police need to have sweeping power under the extraordinary circumstance of a terrorist attack, we also need to have safeguards to provide a sense of balance. Thus, I will approach the Bill on two aspects. First on the special authorisation and next on the Communications Stop Order."
134,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"On the special authorisation by the Commissioner of Police under the Bill, I would like to clarify the following issues with the Minister."
135,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"“A law enforcement officer is defined in clause 2(1) to mean a Police officer, an immigration officer, a narcotics officer, a prisons officer or a Civil Defence Service officer. The class may be expanded by the Minister”, as cited in the explanatory notes. How does the Minister envisage the class to be expanded?"
136,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,The second group of people who can exercise the special powers specified in the special authorisation under subsection 1(c) refers to servicemen or SAF personnel and they “do not act on the direction and in aid of the police officer given the authorisation”. What is the rationale for this? How would the Police and SAF coordinate the operations on the ground? Would it be co-ordinated by Ministers or by a Ministerial Committee or by the Cabinet?
137,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The third group who can exercise the special powers is made of any civilian, cited as a civilian assistant. I note that Minister has clarified that they can include security guards. How are the security guards organised during peace time so that they can better assist the Police during a crisis?"
138,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Fourthly, a Police officer can close a road under section 19 of the Bill or order a curfew under section 21, for up to 24 hours but Commissioner of Police (CP) can extend it. For how long can the CP extend it? Are there any safeguards?"
139,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Lastly, under the scope of the Bill, apart from obvious terrorist attacks where injuries and outright threats to public safety are apparent, it also listed an example of a sit-down demonstration where vehicles or pedestrians may be obstructed but public safety may not be threatened. Why would such incidents fall under this Bill, which has been enacted specifically for counter-terrorism purposes? Moreover, the Police already has the power to deal with a sit-down demonstration under the ambit of unlawful assembly, for example, as defined in the Penal Code."
140,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Next on the Communications Stop Order (CSO). CSO’s main objective is to deprive terrorists or criminals of information. It will also deny the terrorists the opportunity to broadcast their terrorist acts ""live"" through the media like the case of Mumbai attacks in 2008."
141,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"But the CSO is a very blunt instrument. Breaching a CSO carries a penalty of up to S$20,000 and/or two years’ imprisonment. In order to assure the public that the CSO would not be abused, and that there are safeguards in place, I hope the Minister could address and respond to the following two points."
142,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Firstly, print and broadcast journalists exist to provide independent documentation of key events. Singapore’s history is encapsulated in their reports. Hence, it appears harsh to ban the media professionals from doing their jobs. We note that the Police is the only party that would be allowed to make any recordings of the scene when the special powers are exercised. I hope the Minister can direct the Police to release the full footage after the event so that it would not lead to a gap in the documentation of Singapore’s history for future generations and this would also help to counter criticism of any abuse by the Police during the Police operations."
143,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Secondly, to better balance between security and documentation, we could perhaps take a leave from France, which adopted a Code of Conduct for Journalists covering terrorist incidents after the Hypercacher Supermarket siege incident in 2015."
144,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"While not a legal instrument of force, its recommendations for journalists bear thinking about as a possible guide for journalists to be allowed to do their jobs responsibly during such incidents. These include responsible coverage of the event lest the perpetrators are watching and careful phrasing of events so as not to influence the public's perception. While I understand that not all media will cooperate and adhere to the code of conduct, but we should not give up trying and should only use the CSO as a last resort."
145,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the special powers, including the CSO given to the Police under this Bill is wide ranging, potent and have great implications. Let me conclude my speech in Mandarin."
146,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"(In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, the special powers, including the CSO given to the Police under this Bill are wide ranging. Could the Minister give us an idea whether there were previous incidents which would warrant such powers, especially CSO, to be applied? Specifically, would the Little India riot in 2013 or the hijack of SQ117 by four terrorists in 1991 require such special powers?"
147,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"On the whole, the threat of terrorism is real. We have to be prepared for such eventual attack. I would like to ask the Minister whether MHA intends to carry out exercises which will benefit the law enforcement officers, other Government agencies, the media, and the public to better understand the implications of POSSPA; and send a strong signal to all terrorists or would-be terrorists not to touch Singapore. Because you would not succeed easily."
148,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill."
149,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon):Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. It is important to note that this is not the first time the law enforcement agencies have been given special powers to deal with security issues."
150,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The POPA was enacted in 1958 to provide Police with the special powers to deal large-scale communal riots, which were the key threat to Singapore then."
151,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"However, much of the powers in the Act are no longer adequate to deal with today's threats. The threat of terrorism comes in multiple and complex ways, which requires swift and decisive action from our law enforcement and security agencies. Therefore, it is necessary for our agencies to be equipped with the necessary powers to deal with the changing threats."
152,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"As such, I support the Bill that is designed to protect our safety and security. I would like to speak on a few issues."
153,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"First, to justify the broad measures, I am glad the Minister has given several examples on recent terrorist attacks, highlighting why the current laws are inadequate to deal with this and that is why a broad-based measure like this is necessary."
154,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"My next point is, when the broad-based law is in place, sound and reasonable judgement by our low enforcement officers is needed. And this judgement, within any enforcement agency, enforced through the guidelines."
155,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"I recognise that it may not serve our interest to publish internal guidelines which could be potentially exploited by terrorists. Nevertheless, I am heartened that the Government has articulated the broad principles that govern these internal guidelines, especially on the application of lethal force, the two-tier unlocking process of the powers in the law and the need by the Commissioner to unlock individual powers based on the needs."
156,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The need to articulate these broad principles was originally a concern for me, and I wanted to flag them out in my speech today. I am glad that the Minister has provided a clear explanation of these broad principles."
157,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Next, I would like to touch on the issue of limiting communications in the event of a terrorist incident. It makes sense not to have information posted online through public or open channels, be it social media or mainstream media."
158,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,And I appreciate the Second Minister for Home Affairs for clarifying that the victims of terrorist attacks are not prohibited on sending information to security agencies of their situation.
159,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"But I would like the Minister to clarify whether sharing with friends and families on closed networks is also forbidden, perhaps, not video but text messages indicating that there is an attack and please stay away."
160,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"During a crisis, we all want to make sure that our immediate loved ones are safe and stay out of any possible danger zones. So a flurry of messages within close networks can be expected. Some would also argue that if this information does not spill over to the public networks, or to the social media, the risk of the terrorist getting wind of getting useful information is also quite limited."
161,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Lastly, I hope the Government can invest in more effort to share this aspect of the law with our people. Perhaps, we can remind people on the onset of any serious terrorist incident that such a law is in place and the communication limitation is also in place."
162,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"And this is because, while a limitation of communication is necessary, this provision goes against the initial instinct that many people have to share such information with their loved ones in times of crisis. With that, I support the Bill."
163,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines):Mr Speaker, Singapore has been extremely fortunate to remain safe and secure during a time where many cities experience terrorist attacks and serious incidents such as hostage-taking, sit-down protests turning into violence protest. We must not stop anticipating in preparing to meet this threat. In doing so, the challenges faced by other security forces and jurisdictions are informative. Where practicable and instructive, we must learn and implement policies and procedures that can best our residents and officers."
164,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"This Bill is important in enhancing the powers of the Police to deal with serious incidents and security threats, including terrorist attacks. The special powers proposed in this Bill will help Police officers to carry out this very difficult jobs to save lives and neutralise threats, in particular, the powers to protect the integrity of tactical operations are critical for operational success."
165,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Some members of the public have raised concerns about the provision to allow the Commissioner of Police to issue a ""Communications Stop Order"" (CSO). Their worry is that should this order be in effect, innocent bystanders who had unwittingly taken a photograph might be punished for a crime that they did not intend to commit. Others feel that this provision will affect the transparency of handling and managing security incidents."
166,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"These concerns are valid, and I seek the Minister's clarification and re-assurance that the CSO will only be activated for exceptional situations where operational secrecy and integrity are critical to saving lives and protecting property, and that sufficient awareness and visibility will be in place to show that a CSO is in place."
167,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In critical security situations, the safety of the public and officers is paramount. I have commanded a few operations during my 13 years with the Police Force. This included gunman operations, kidnapping, manhunt for suspects who committed capital offences. We realised that all operations are inherently risky but those of this nature are especially dangerous to officers. I had gone into dangerous situations with my officers, knowing full well that the risk can only be managed but not totally eliminated. The responsibility was heavy. I wanted my officers to return safely. Tactical secrecy and integrity are critical to minimising risk. I constantly worried about the loss of the element of surprise and our suspects ready to inflict grievous harm on my raiding officers. I could not afford information leakages. I certainly could not allow prioritising any sharing of pictures involving the crime scene and the operations over the safety of officers and Singaporeans."
168,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Back then, I did not have to contend with Facebook ""'live"", ""live"" Twitter feeds and the fast spread of news though apps like WhatsApp. I only had to manage and very rarely, the odd photographer with telescopic lens. There were no drones to contend with; information sharing was rather limited and much slower through MMS and SMS."
169,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"During the trial of Ajmal Kasab, the prime accused of Mumbai terrorist attack on 26 November 2008, Justices Aftab Alam and CK Prasad called the ""live"" coverage of the security operations ""reckless"". According to the newspaper, The Hindu, they said, ""it is not possible to find out whether the security forces actually suffered any casualties or injuries on account of the way the operations were being displayed on the TV screen. But it is beyond doubt that the way their operations were fully shown made the task of the security forces not only exceedingly difficult but also dangerous and risky."""
170,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Our media personnel are responsible and will not seek to compromise operations. However, the operational terrain today is a lot more complex because of social media channels. Thus, the CSO is critical to protecting lives. So is the proposal to provide the Police with the power to take down autonomous vehicles in an attack, as these can compromise tactical secrecy."
171,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"With regard to the issue of lack of transparency, every Police officer seeks to live up to the Police's oath to protect life and property. We can trust that they will discharge their duties professionally. There is no reason to believe that we need allowing people on Facebook ""live"" or any other social media channels to monitor their operations in order that they may execute their mission professionally."
172,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"While I support the proposals in this Bill, there must be greater public education on these matters. I would like to ask the Minister for his plans on public education and awareness for these measures. As we have done numerous simulated terrorist attacks to prepare our security agencies and other stakeholders including the public, may I suggest that a mock CSO be included in future exercises as a way of promoting greater awareness on this matter."
173,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, allow me to continue in Chinese."
174,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"(In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, Sir, all over the world, terrorist attacks and serious incidents occur constantly. Although there are no similar incidents happening in Singapore yet, we must always stay alert and be prepared for the contingencies. We not only need to strengthen our security measures, but also increase our enforcement powers in case a serious incident happens."
175,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The Communication Stop Order and the power given to the police to restrict the use of drones is of great importance. In order to successfully execute a high-risk operation, tactical secrecy is critical. When I was a police officer, I took part in many enforcement operations. Every operation was risky, manhunt for suspects and raids are especially dangerous. When leading an operation, I was always concerned about external disturbances, for example, intrusion by innocent passers-by. If it was not handled properly, life of the police officers, victims and the public could be endangered. With this new clause in place, the Police will be able to focus on the operations to arrest the terrorists and criminals."
176,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The second important clause in this Bill is that the police is given the power to ask operators to assist in the operation. When an incident occurs, the police will be able to order the operators at the site to assist police operation and investigation. Under police request, they must suspend their operation for the time being. When a serious crime occurs, time is critical for enforcement and investigation. Although operators are mostly willing to cooperate, however, there may be exceptions. I hope MHA can explain to the operators MHA’s requirement and their duty under this clause."
177,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,This Bill is an important link in our anti-terrorism and crime-fighting framework. I support this Bill.
178,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio):Mr Speaker, Sir, as we look at terror incidents around the world, the methods used by terrorists have been evolving in order to inflict maximum damage and strike fear into the hearts of target communities. Even though there have been no attacks in Singapore so far, there is no guarantee that such incidents will not happen here. We must be prepared and equipped, both at the national level where our security agencies have oversight and at the individual level. We must cooperate and work together to protect our homeland."
179,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In this respect, refraining from communicating at the sites of terror attacks is one of the ways individuals can cooperate with and assist our security forces. Their actions, or rather, the lack of, could potentially save the lives of the unfortunate ones caught in the event and those of the men and women who risk their own to rescue them."
180,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"However, there are some concerns over the ban on the transmission of photos, videos, text and audio messages. I think it is worth our time to examine more thoroughly the implications of this ban."
181,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Part of the anxiety expressed so far stems from the novelty of the proposal, which is probably unprecedented. I understand that Singapore is among the first in the world to introduce such legislation. I agree with the intent as it aims to protect everyone and it will empower our security agencies to mount an effective response, should we ever need it one day."
182,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"We should draw lessons from the 1972 Munich Olympic incident, the 2008 Mumbai terror attack and the 2015 Paris terrorist attack. The efforts of the security forces in all three incidents were severely compromised by television broadcasts."
183,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Today, rescuers have more than TV crews to worry about. With a smartphone in hand, anyone can be a broadcaster, streaming real-time updates, which can potentially provide valuable information to perpetrators and give them a strategic advantage. This is what the Bill clearly seeks to prevent."
184,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"What the Ministry could have communicated better and much more strongly is that the Bill does not seek to prevent hostages or witnesses at the sites from communicating with the authorities, especially information about the attackers and their operations."
185,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"As part of our SG Secure campaign, our Home Team has been educating Singaporeans about what to do in the event of an attack – ""Run, Hide, Tell"". We tell Singaporeans to move away from danger, stay out of sight, switch their phones to silent mode and provide information to the Police by calling, SMSing or using the SGSecure App. This advisory has not changed. However, I hope the Ministry will consider allowing communications via other additional platforms in the event that these official channels become overloaded or malfunction."
186,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"On the other hand, in case the terrorists or their sympathisers manage to transmit images or text in the midst of the mayhem, I hope we are equipped with the technology and know-how to jam the signals and prevent their broadcasts. Fines and jail-time are not going to be deterrents for them."
187,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Lastly, regarding the concerns by civil society groups over the definition of a ""serious incident"", I would like to caution that we should not assume that nothing would happen, even at seemingly small gatherings or peaceful protests. The risk of escalation is always there. It is the duty of the Police to protect everyone, regardless of language, race, religion, political convictions and beliefs."
188,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Hence, to address the possibility of abuse whilst the communication ban is imposed, I would like to suggest we tap on the use of technology, such as equipping every policeman with a body video recorder. The record could be reviewed by an independent committee and the composition of the members can be discussed to ensure independence."
189,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin."
190,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"(In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] As the saying goes, ""Don’t fear what is, fear what if"". Every Singaporean must stay vigilant, and must not think that terrorist attacks will never happen to them. We must prepare for the rainy days. We do not have to be overly panicky, however, it is better to remain cautious. If we stay united, we will succeed."
191,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mr Speaker,"Mr Speaker : Second Minister, Josephine Teo."
192,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Speaker, I thank the Members for speaking in support of the Bill. They raised many useful points which I shall try to address."
193,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Several Members asked about the definition of ""serious incident"", specifically the inclusion of ""acts causing large-scale public disorder"" and the illustration (d) in clause 3 which describes such an incident. Ms K Thanaletchimi asked whether non-violent, passive protests are covered under the Act. Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Kok Heng Leun, Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Louis Ng asked why the same powers to deal with terrorism are also available for large-scale public disorder."
194,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Outside of the House, there were even assertions that POSSPA will be applied to ""peaceful demonstrations"". The narrative goes something like this: first, the law allows POSSPA to be unlocked by the Minister for ""peaceful protests"". Such protests can attract crowds of all sizes. There is no definition of what ""large-scale public disorder"" means, so the law could be applied to peaceful protests involving a small group of protestors. Therefore, the law potentially allows the oppression of protesters, and will have a chilling effect on society. We have come across such assertions outside the House."
195,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,These assertions misrepresent what POSSPA is about. Let me explain why.
196,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"There are three limbs under the meaning of ""serious incident"": a terrorist act; serious violence affecting the public; or large-scale public disorder."
197,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The third limb, large-scale public disorder, is the subject of focus. It is not new, by the way. POPA already provided for it since 1958. In any case, peaceful protests are not the target of POSSPA. Let me say that again – peaceful protests are not the target of POSSPA."
198,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"We will only invoke POSSPA if the situation deteriorates, and the threat of large-scale public-disorder or violence becomes imminent. If a protest is really peaceful, there should be no concern whatsoever about falling within the third limb of ""large-scale public disorder"". Illustration (d) in clause 3 makes it clear what we mean by ""large-scale public disorder""."
199,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"I should just quote to Members what it actually says. It goes like this: ""a sit-down demonstration for a cause attracts a large group of sympathisers who voluntarily join the sit-in. For over a week, the group grows and the demonstrators start to occupy the publicly accessible paths and other open spaces in the central business district. Their presence starts to impede the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic and interfere with normal trade or business activities in the area""."
200,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"There are several parts to this. The protest was protracted; over a week. It involved a large and growing group. They occupied public places in the CBD. The last sentence is worth repeating. The demonstration ""starts to impede the flow of … traffic and interfere with normal trade or business activities in the area""."
201,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The illustration shows quite clearly that not every protest will meet the high threshold to be considered a serious incident. What is required? There must be significant disruption to ordinary Singaporeans trying to go about their daily business. People – motorists, commuters, passers-by, shopkeepers, workers – are agitated. The tension is rising. If it is not diffused, things could quickly turn chaotic."
202,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Some observers think such a situation is not intolerable, well within acceptable threshold. Mr Kok Heng Leun suggests that situation should not be treated as a ""serious incident"". Is that the view of most Singaporeans? I do not think so. In fact, in such a situation, it is more likely that the Police will be asked: ""Why are you allowing this chaos to unfold?"", ""Are you not worried something worse will happen?"", ""Can't you do something to prevent an escalation?"""
203,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The Police will have to make a judgement call. If they stick with existing policing powers, can they bring the situation under control? What if the chaos spins out of control and there is loss of lives? If they assess the need to seek powers under POSSPA, do they have enough justification? What if they invoked POSSPA, and were in fact able to restore order but were then accused of having over-reacted? That they misjudged? That there was no need to have used POSSPA?"
204,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"There are no easy answers. Police will have to judge, the Minister will have to judge, and decide. This alone is not a low threshold to cross."
205,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Since Independence, POPA has only been used once. This was after the Little India riot and, even then, it was tightly scoped to control the consumption of alcohol, to calm the situation and prevent further violence. Police did not use any other power in POPA, even though they could."
206,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Kok Heng Leun asked why existing powers in other laws are not enough to deal with the large-scale public disorder scenarios described in illustrations (d) and (e)."
207,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Let us take illustration (d), although most of it applies to illustration (e) as well. This is a large and protracted demonstration that is causing significant disruption to Singaporeans. The demonstration keeps growing and things could get chaotic. Police may assess that they need to take measures to reduce the risk of property damage or prevent the crowd from further building up. To do this, the Police may need to order nearby premises to close, impose a cordon, and direct people to stay out of the area. The POSSPA powers are necessary to do this. No other laws have such provisions for such a situation."
208,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Another example which occurred in Singapore: in the aftermath of the Little India riot, we activated POPA and used the POPA power to regulate conduct to stop the consumption of alcohol in public places in Little India. Given the large crowds on weekends and public holidays, alcohol was assessed to be a significant risk factor for public disorder. Police did not have the power to do this outside of POPA until this Parliament passed new legislation under the Liquor Control Act to regulate the consumption of liquor in public places."
209,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Louis Ng, Ms Sylvia Lim and Ms K Thanaletchimi asked, how about the Communications Stop Order? Will it be used for the scenario set out in illustration (d)?"
210,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,Let me be clear. The CSO is not meant for peaceful assemblies. Ms Sylvia Lim said that law enforcement operations in large-scale public disorder would not tactically be sensitive to warrant CSO. I agree. I have explained in my earlier speech that strict conditions must be met before the Commissioner of Police can issue a CSO. It must be to protect the safety of the public or law enforcement operations. This confirms Mr Christopher de Souza's understanding also.
211,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"I have also explained in my earlier speech that not all the powers become automatically available once the Minister issues the Activation Order. The Commissioner of Police must assess which of the powers are necessary to deal with the situation. So, it is not the case that when there is large-scale public disorder, all the special powers of POSSPA will be used to deal with the incident."
212,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Louis Ng asked if we could put a number to what is considered ""large-scale"". His question is understandable, but there is also no easy answer."
213,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The size of the protest is one of many factors. It depends also where the protest is conducted, how it is conducted and its consequences on Singapore, whether intended by its organisers or not. As Mr Gan Thiam Poh has pointed out, a ""peaceful demonstration"" can quickly degenerate into violence and threaten public safety."
214,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"An example is the London Riots in 2011. It started off as a peaceful demonstration against a court ruling. But degenerated into rioting, looting, setting buildings and vehicles on fire. It spread to several cities over the course of the summer, including Birmingham, Leicester and Manchester. In its trail, there were five dead and 205 injured, of which 189 were police officers. Property damage was estimated at £200 million, and the impact on the economy was significant."
215,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Another example is the Charlottesville rally in 2017. This took place against the backdrop of the controversial removal of Confederate monuments in parts of the US, in response to the Charleston church shooting in 2015. It started with a protest against the removal of a Confederate monument from a public park. Protestors chanted racist slogans while carrying rifles and banners. The protestors clashed violently with counter-protestors."
216,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The Virginia governor declared a state of emergency in order to have additional powers to safeguard public safety. One of the protestors rammed a car into a group of counter-protestors, killing one and injuring 19. By the time the violence was over, there were three dead and at least 38 injured."
217,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,The point is this: peaceful intent does not guarantee peaceful outcomes.
218,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Having explained what ""large scale public disorder"" means, I will explain what it is not. Where possible, we will indeed use existing laws to deal with such situations. For example, in Singapore, public assemblies are allowed in accordance with the law. This comes under the framework of the Public Order Act. The Police regularly grants permits for public assemblies: last year alone, over 900."
219,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"We have also set up the Speakers’ Corner for Singaporeans to organise events and demonstrations without having to apply for a permit, as long as certain conditions are met. Many events take place at the Speakers’ Corner. POSSPA cannot be used against demonstrations if these demonstrations do not cross the threshold of threatening ""large scale public disorder"", or ""serious violence""."
220,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"For example, recent student demonstrations at Dublin Scioto High School in Columbus, Ohio. About 200 students sat outside the school in silence to protest gun violence in the wake of the Florida school shooting in February 2018."
221,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"There was no violence or large scale public disorder in this example. If such an event happens in Singapore, it can be dealt with using baseline policing powers. The POA will be sufficient. In fact, this is what we have done in the past."
222,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"An example is the 2013 illegal protests at Merlion Park. Around 100 foreigners gathered to protest the 2013 Malaysian elections on two different days. They held up signs and chanted slogans. We issued a total of 74 conditional warnings under the POA. POPA was not invoked then. So, our record is clear and consistent – we have never used POPA against political dissent."
223,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, to reiterate: POSSPA is not targeted at peaceful demonstrations or protests. It is targeted at terrorist acts, serious violence affecting the public and large-scale public disorder. As Mr Christopher de Souza reminded us right at the beginning, ""we do not want the Police to be unprepared, left inadequately protected, because they are bereft of what they need to quell a threat"". In a serious incident, Singaporeans expect Police to be able to act fast and to act decisively. That is what POSSPA seeks to do."
224,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"I will next address Members' queries on the specific clauses. Mr Melvin Yong asked how Police would deal with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), if they are unable to find the operator."
225,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Clauses 28(2)(b)(ii) and 28(3)(b)(ii) empower Police officers to act against UAVs and AVs directly, even if the operator cannot be located. The priority is to stop the UAV or AV. AVs and UAVs are a relatively new area, which the SAF and the Home Team are both working on. SAF is developing a ""drone catcher"". The Home Team is also working on technology to target drones."
226,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked what would constitute ""reasonable steps"" under the law for companies or their officers to absolve themselves from liability for obligations under POSSPA. It will be a question of fact in each case whether a corporation's officer can be shown to have taken all reasonable steps to prevent or stop the commission of an offence by the corporation."
227,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"To illustrate, clause 27 allows Police to direct premise owners to take certain actions like closing the premises. If the owner or if the officer of a corporation can show that he actually gave instructions for the premises to be closed, but those instructions were inadvertently not followed, then he will not be liable."
228,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Louis Ng has asked why enhanced powers to stop and question individuals are needed under POSSPA, and whether these were excessive."
229,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In a serious incident where POSSPA is activated, Police need to be able to obtain information quickly in order to deal with the incident. These enhanced powers make it clear that individuals have an onus to comply. For example, when Police are searching for an unknown terrorist suspect, to stop and question individuals to ask for information, they must be able to get the information quickly, in order to trace the suspect. Otherwise, Police will waste precious time."
230,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Louis Ng asked for clarity on what constitutes ""reasonable force"". In a serious incident, Police officers and the public are faced with considerable danger, and the Police will need to be legally empowered to use lethal weapons, if indeed necessary."
231,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"POSSPA allows the use of such force, as is ""reasonably necessary"" to effect arrests and enforce certain powers. This means that the officer can use such force, as is reasonable in the circumstances, and no more."
232,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Operationally, and as a matter of policy, Police will use lethal weapons only if they have no other choice. The Police do not want to use lethal weapons unless all other options have been exhausted. There are clear internal Police procedures and rules to ensure that Police officers act as such. Therefore, Police officers are typically equipped with a range of force options, including unarmed tactics, and non-lethal options like batons and Tasers. Police officers are trained to apply the appropriate force options in accordance with the situation."
233,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The Police’s record speaks for itself. The Police have very rarely used lethal weapons. Take the Little India riot again. In fact, the Police came under criticism from some quarters, which suggested they should have used their firearms to deal with the rioters. In that situation, the Police assessed the use of lethal weapons was not necessary and exercised restraint from using firearms."
234,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"On the other hand, there are times when the use of lethal weapons is necessary and justified. Take the car that sped through concrete blocks at a Police checkpoint at the Shangri-la Dialogue in 2015. This was a high-profile event, with many foreign dignitaries in attendance. The risk that the car could be committing an act of terrorism was high. How would we know what was in the car? The Police had to use reasonable force, in this case, lethal weapons, to deal with the threat."
235,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Ang Wei Neng has also asked how SAF and the Police would coordinate operations on the ground. The Police have worked closely with the SAF to develop joint plans for terror attacks. Both forces have also exercised closely together on many counter-terrorism exercises. In October 2016, the Police and SAF conducted a major joint Home Team-SAF counter-terrorism exercise. This was followed by Exercise Northstar in October 2017, a multi-agency counter-terrorism coordination exercise involving private stakeholders."
236,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Kok Heng Leun, and Mr Louis Ng have also asked for clarifications on civilians assisting the Police under POSSPA. For example, whether they will be sufficiently trained, and how we can ensure their safety."
237,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"As I have mentioned in my earlier speech, civilian assistants can only exercise selected powers, under police officers' directions. There are no powers to compel civilians to aid the Police; they can only do so voluntarily. Before requesting civilians to aid the Police, the Police will consider the suitability of the task at hand, and the risks to civilians. As Mr Kok correctly points out, in some cases, it may be detrimental to deploy the civilians. The Mandarin saying is: 成 事 不 足, 败 事 有 余. That can happen. We agree."
238,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The volunteers will therefore not be assigned to tasks that will put them in harm’s way, or which they are quite incapable of performing. The Police conducted an exercise in October 2016. The scenario involved multiple gunmen attacks at a shopping mall. In this exercise, mall security officers assisted the Police by evacuating the public to safety, and no more than that. It is an example of the kind of roles civilian assistants may be tasked with."
239,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Ang Wei Neng has also asked about the class of public officers who may be prescribed as ""law enforcement officers"". As the threats continue to evolve over time, our operational needs will change. This provision simply allows the Minister to prescribe specific groups of public officers with specialised skills to assist the Police in responding to the serious incidents, for example, cyber security specialists, or whoever else."
240,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, there have been a number of queries raised by Members on the Communications Stop Order (CSO). I would first like to acknowledge the support that Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Desmond Choo have voiced for the Bill, in particular for the CSO. As former Police officers, they understand the challenges and risks that Police officers face, and the need for the special powers in this Bill to deal with serious incidents."
241,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,Mr Desmond Choo asked whether the CSO will only be activated for exceptional situations where operational secrecy and integrity are critical for saving lives and protecting property. Mr Ang Wei Neng suggested adopting a Code of Conduct for journalists and using the CSO as a last resort. Mr Choo and Mr Henry Kwek asked whether the public will be notified when the CSO is place.
242,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The short answer to Mr Choo’s question is, yes, as I have explained earlier in my speech. Mr Ang's suggestion on the media Code of Conduct is a useful one which we will consider. But the fact is this: in a serious incident, we cannot rely solely on a Code of Conduct. The objective of the CSO is to send a clear signal to the public to stop making and communicating films or pictures, stop communicating messages on law enforcement activities in the target area. The Police will publicise the CSO through all its public communications platforms."
243,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Other Members raised some concerns on the CSO, which can be grouped into four categories: one, whether the CSO will stop people from sending information to the Police, or sending updates on their situation to their loved ones; two, whether the CSO would lead to less accountability for the actions of the Police; three, why should mere making of films be banned; and four, how the CSO will be enforced in practice."
244,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Firstly, whether the CSO is intended to stop members of the public caught up in the incident from sending updates to their loved ones. This was raised by Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Louis Ng."
245,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"I have said in my earlier speech that the CSO is not aimed at civilians who may be caught in a hostage situation, and are trying to get information to their loved ones. The CSO is intended to stop irresponsible communication of on-going security operations which may endanger lives, such as those of hostages."
246,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Therefore, when the Police look into reports lodged on breaches of the CSO, it will consider the circumstances of the sender and if the breach could reasonably have been avoided or should have been avoided, if the actions posed safety risk to the public or to the law enforcement officers, or if the leaked film exposed sensitive tactical information of the law enforcement activity."
247,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Some Members, like Mr Melvin Yong, Ms Thanaletchimi, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh, asked whether the CSO would stop people from communicating information to the Police, or discourage them from doing so."
248,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, the public plays an important role in providing information to assist the Police. The Police is more aware than anyone else of this. The objective of the CSO is to protect the integrity of specific security operations at a particular location and for a limited time. Outside of the scope of the CSO, there is no restriction on communications in general. This will be made clear.    "
249,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The public will be encouraged to submit information to the Police via the ""999"" hotline or through the iWitness and SGSecure platforms. If members of the public who are acting in good faith to provide information to the authorities, but inadvertently breached the CSO, we do not intend to take action against such persons. I hope this assurance addresses Ms Lim's concerns."
250,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Secondly, Members like Ms Thanaletchimi have also asked whether the CSO would lead to less accountability for the actions of the Police and a lack of independent documentation. Ms Sylvia Lim said that without film or photo, the burden would fall on the complainant to prove the complaint. She also cited the example of Mr Tomlinson at the G20 Summit in 2009. In the first instance, it is unlikely that the CSO would have been issued in a public order incident, like the one she described. It was not the kind of scenario in which we had envisioned CSO to be issued."
251,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"But with or without footage, any person with a complaint of misconduct by police officers can lodge a police report, and they regularly do. Without footage, Ms Lim is right that it may be harder for the Police to verify the complaint. However, the Police's investigations do not start and end with photo or video evidence. They can interview the parties involved and gather other evidence to establish the validity of the claim."
252,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Police have always taken a serious view of all complaints made against our officers and will thoroughly investigate these complaints. If the complaint is substantiated, the Police will not hesitate to take action against any errant officer."
253,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,Mr Kok Heng Leun also asked whether the Police will use the powers under the CSO to delete videos and photos of abuse of powers by the Police. It is a criminal offence to dispose of evidence and Police officers cannot do that.
254,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh suggested equipping every Police officer with a Body-worn Camera to mitigate the risk of unfair allegations when a CSO is in place. This is a helpful suggestion, and we will look into it."
255,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In fact, the Police have equipped a number of their frontline officers with Body-worn Cameras to facilitate investigations and the gathering of evidence. The footage from these cameras are also helpful for any allegations of wrongdoing. This is on top of the in-vehicle cameras that Police have. These cameras will continue to operate when a CSO is in place."
256,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"This leaves me with the third and fourth group of issues under the CSO, which I will address together. Besides issues of accountability, Ms Lim expressed discomfort with extending the CSO to the making of relevant pictures and films. Ms Lim's view is that mere making of the film does not cause harm and should be allowed."
257,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Louis Ng also asked how the CSO will be enforced by officers on the ground. For example, there could be many people using their phones at the same time for different reasons."
258,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"As I explained earlier, during a serious incident, the Police will not have the bandwidth to investigate every person who is recording a film or picture to ascertain its true intent. Ms Lim also acknowledged from her experience, as a former Police officer, that this is a challenge. The Police will exercise discretion and take into consideration the circumstances which the recorder was in, and if the breach could not have been reasonably avoided."
259,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"This Bill puts the onus on the individuals to not arouse suspicion of malicious intent not because the Police want to make things difficult, but because of exigency. By doing so, the Police have a straightforward enforcement aim to make sure no one is recording. If it were not spelt out this clearly, then you could have a situation of confusion: what exactly are the Police trying to enforce against?"
260,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked a similar point: why is the possession of materials likely to prejudice public order a criminal offence. The same consideration applies here. In a serious incident, Police will not have the bandwidth to sort out those who have malicious intent, and those who do not. And, if I may add, this particular provision has been around since 1958 and the Police have never enforced it."
261,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, there have been many questions on the CSO. This is why MHA earlier spoke to the local media to hear their concerns and discuss how we can work closely to ensure that the CSO does not disrupt their ability to report the news for documentation purposes. The local media also raised concerns similar to Members and the general public. For example, how to ensure that those caught in the incident can report to the Police? We have taken this into account, and in my earlier speech, I also talked about the importance of post-incident reporting and how we will allow the media to record incidents for subsequent reporting."
262,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked if there was a public consultation for this Bill. We studied international incidents, spoke to our law enforcement counterparts and gleaned learning points on how to deal with these incidents. Then we consulted key stakeholders who would be directly affected by the exercise of specific powers. This was the same approach for the Public Order (Amendment) Bill, as well as the Infrastructure Protection Bill just last year. So, there is no change."
263,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,I will now move on to the issue of safeguards for POSSPA powers. Mr Henry Kwek has asked whether there will be any limits to the duration the provisions will stay in effect.
264,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Under POSSPA, the duration of each Activation Order is capped at one month, after which the Minister must make a new Activation Order if he assesses that there is a basis for the new Order. We do not intend to use the POSSPA powers for longer than is absolutely necessary. After a serious incident has been resolved, one of our key priorities is to work with the affected communities to return to normalcy as soon as possible. Having an Activation Order longer than necessary does not help."
265,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Kok asked why the failure to publish would not invalidate an order. Again, there is nothing sinister. All that clause 8(3) does is to ensure that the mere failure to publish the Activation Order does not invalidate the need for the Commissioner of Police to issue a special authorisation and deploy the Police officers. This does not diminish accountability of the Minister. It can happen that the Commissioner of Police may need to act quickly and issue the special authorisations. He should not be prevented from doing so just because of a delay in publishing the Minister's Activation Order, which is a technicality. This is what the provision seeks to protect, nothing more."
266,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,Mr Melvin Yong asked whether a new Activation Order would be needed if subsequent incidents are unrelated to the first incident for which the Activation Order was made. The Commissioner of Police will only be able to issue special authorisations for incidents that have a nexus to the incident that led to the Activation Order.
267,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"If there is a subsequent serious incident that does not have a nexus to the initial incident, the Minister must issue a fresh Activation Order for POSSPA powers to be used. For example, if large-scale public disorder occurs, that is unrelated to a terrorist act for which an Activation Order has been issued, Minister would need to issue a new Activation Order to be able to exercise POSSPA powers for the new incident."
268,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"However, Mr Yong makes a more important point about whose judgement it will be in deciding whether the two incident areas are related. It will have to be a professional assessment made by the Police based on the information at hand. The Commissioner will have to decide before he issues a special authorisation."
269,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Kok Heng Leun raised a similar line of query in many parts of his speech. I listened carefully and I must say, for me, it contrasted very much with Ms Sylvia Lim's speech, which I believe to be well-informed by her professional experience as a Police officer and her legal training. I reflected on Mr Kok's point and I think his main discomfort has to do with the discretion given to the Minister and the Commissioner of Police. Whether we should trust them to act honourably at all times or whether we should curtail their discretion and not leave it to change. Therefore, he asked whether we can impose conditions under which the powers are used and whether these conditions can be written into the Act."
270,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In my view, it is not unreasonable to consider such risks. Not unreasonable. In fact, Mr Kok cited the ISA in which we subject the decisions of the Minister to the concurrence by the President on the advice of a Special Advisory Committee. This shows clearly that the Government − this Government − is not adverse to introducing such checks if there are good justifications to do so. And on a day-to-day basis, Ministers and the Commissioner of Police do not have as much latitude in their exercise of powers."
271,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"However, the POSSPA Bill is designed for serious incidents as per clause 3 where we envision Police to be in a race against time. Hypothetically, suppose terrorists have taken some Singaporeans hostage, can we afford to put the rescue operations on hold while Parliament debates whether the Minister's Activation Order or the Commissioner's CSO are justified?"
272,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"And in a terror situation, things can change by the minute. Supposing in the meantime, the terrorists start to harm the hostages and we decide we can no longer wait. Police mount a rescue operation but, predictably, there was live coverage of the Police operations online. The result: casualties. Would it not weigh on our conscience that we have not given the hostages or the security personnel the best chance of survival because the CSO was not authorised in time?"
273,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Ultimately, it boils down to this: there is a risk of too much discretion, but there is also a risk of too much delay. Members will have to weigh which is the bigger risk in a serious incident; which has the graver consequence. This tension was also highlighted by Mr Christopher de Souza, who concluded that “this Bill equips the Police with the level of power necessary to quell danger and neutralise an escalating target”. I am still quoting Mr de Souza, ""The foundation of my argument is that we have a good police force.”"
274,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Perhaps not everywhere in the world but, in Singapore, we can and should trust that the Police will discharge their duties professionally. Mr Desmond Choo echoed this point."
275,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"I hope Members can be persuaded that the threshold, which must be met before the POSSPA powers can be activated, is high. This means that the special powers will not be used for day-to-day policing. It can only be used in exceptional circumstances with many conditions attached already, as some Members have pointed out."
276,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Once the threshold of a serious incident is crossed, we must give the police sufficient latitude to act decisively and respond to whatever the threat may be. Ms Sylvia Lim used two terms. She said ""muscle"" and ""flexibility"". And I think that sums it up aptly. You need the muscle, you need the flexibility in a serious incident. You need both. After the incident has been dealt with, and the danger has passed, we can have a debate, including here in Parliament, about whether the Minister and the Police did the right thing, and hold them to account. We did that for the Little India riot. We had an inquiry. The inquiry was fairly extended, and the inquiry certainly did point out areas that the members of the panel thought the Government had fallen short on. But you do that after the incident has been dealt with."
277,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"We therefore agree that it is important for the public to be aware of the obligations under the new Bill when an activation order is in place. Ms Thanaletchimi, Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Desmond Choo have all asked how we intend to do so."
278,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, when an Activation Order is issued by the Minister, it will be publicised via press releases and online and social media platforms. The areas which the Commissioner of Police will authorise Police officers to exercise special powers in will also be publicised via all platforms, where appropriate."
279,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"MHA will also continue to inform the public on the key points of POSSPA, like what to do when a Communications Stop Order is in place. We will do so via our Home Team outreach channels, such as SGSecure."
280,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"To increase awareness, Mr Desmond Choo and Mr Ang Wei Neng have suggested conducting exercises for the public on how the powers will be used, especially for the CSO. This is a very helpful suggestion, and is something that the Police will consider."
281,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Mr Speaker, I hope I have addressed Members' concerns. The special powers under POSSPA are needed to deal with serious incidents, like terrorist attacks. The special powers, which come with safeguards, will be used judiciously."
282,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"As the threats have changed and technologies have changed, we must ensure that the Police are empowered to respond to these new threats. Sir, I beg to move."
283,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mr Kok Heng Leun,"Mr Kok Heng Leun: Thank you, Second Minister for your reply. I was listening very intently to your argument. There are two points which I still feel a bit uncomfortable. One is the definition of the ""illustration"" in question, which was illustration D. Just by the mere words of it, to be honest, I do not sense that kind of seriousness as you have described and your subsequent elaboration of what the situation could be."
284,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"So, I would like to ask may be, in this Bill itself, there should be some change of wording in that part of the illustration whereby it is not just about a disruption to daily businesses, but a protracted disruption. That would make it sound in terms of the severity, in comparison to what you have said. At the same time, when things are still quite peaceful at that moment, any kind of police intervention may, under this Bill, actually cause even more problems subsequently. That is the first clarification."
285,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The second one is about asking for accountability from the Ministers and the Commissioners. I think just because this Bill is so severe in terms of the action that comes with it, I am asking if that is really not because there is a mistrust, I guess a kind of accountability. That is, why in my speech, I did say that as much as time can permit without affecting the expediency of the Police action, I think even an official report on the decision of the Minister or the Commissioner would be very important to be submitted to Parliament in that process."
286,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"I think that is what we really need in terms of accountability. And by putting such a procedure in place, it actually places all of us, or even the parliamentarians here, plus the Commissioner and the Minister, to a kind of accountability that is open and transparent."
287,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Speaker, I thank Mr Kok for his two questions. I hear what the Member says about illustration (d) and I think the purpose of a debate on legislation is very often to illuminate on what is in the Bill so that Parliament has a record of the intent of the movers of the Bill. And the explanations that go into the Hansard constitute part of the interpretation of the Bill. So, whilst I understand the nature of Mr Kok's request, I hope he appreciates that what has been said in this House, in the course of this debate, forms a substantial basis for us to have a proper interpretation of the Bill. That is to the first question that he asked."
288,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"To the second question on accountability, Mr Kok is looking at it from the point of view of whether or not you trust the individuals. How do you hold them to account? I would put to Mr Kok, look at it from the point of view of the person who has to exercise these powers. What is the weight of the office that he will feel? His immediate thought is, “This is serious stuff. I have to make the call. I can be asked a question in Parliament and probably not just one. Can I justify this action?”"
289,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Is this not accountability? Does this not already encapsulate what Mr Kok says? As I have said, it is not a low threshold at all. If it were such a low threshold, if it was so easy for the Minister to be able to activate POPA, or the powers, then I do not think, in 60 years, the number of times in which you can attribute POPA powers to have been invoked, to be countable on one hand. That would not be the case."
290,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mr Kok Heng Leun,"Mr Kok Heng Leun: Thank you, Minister, for the reply. With regard to the second reply, I think we are sort of in the same place and, in a way, I do agree that it is a heavy and difficult decision. That is why I think that the more difficult and heavier it is, the procedure of accountability becomes even more important. That is why I am not suggesting that we have to call Parliament up to have a deliberation on that immediately. But, in certain circumstances, if Parliament needs to sit to deliberate on something really important, I think the Parliament has that moral responsibility to do that."
291,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"In this particular case, I am talking about a report after the activation would really be very important to actually lay out how the decision was being made, the threshold we need, without asking for COIs and things like that. So, it is just about a certain procedure so that we could also respect the kind of heavy responsibility that these people are making and they are affecting every individual, at least within that vicinity, of course, also the whole of Singapore."
292,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Speaker, I would like to ask Mr Kok what would prevent him from filing a Parliamentary Question to ask the Minister to account for his actions. He does not need a procedure for that. He can already do so.  "
293,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mr Kok Heng Leun,"Mr Kok Heng Leun: I think, of course, we can always file a PQ in Parliament, but I am just seeking a kind of procedure rather than each time relying on the PQs. And we only meet once a month for that. So, in that moment, as soon as it can, if possible, I do not find that it is a problem to submit a report.  "
294,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mrs Josephine Teo:Mr Speaker, if a serious incident as envisioned in clause 3 has happened, do you not think that the public demands an explanation? Do you not think that the public would already expect a report to be tabled? And that even without a Parliamentary Question, any self-respecting Minister knows that he has to respond. I do not think you need to write it into a Bill. The Minister will have to stand for election. We do not know what timeframe, but he will have to, at some point. And if he has not thought about accountability, something must be seriously wrong. So, I am quite baffled by Mr Kok's insistence on this point. It is a concern that I am not quite sure I understand fully because there is already nothing that prevents Parliament from debating incidents. Far smaller scale incidents have been discussed at length in Parliament. And when a serious incident happens, I cannot imagine that it will not be brought to Parliament for discussion."
295,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Question put, and agreed to."
296,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

400,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,Order for the amendment of the Singapore Armed Forces Act read.
401,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Chairman, I beg to move, ""That the new clause be read a Second time."" "
402,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,I propose a new clause introducing amendments to the Singapore Armed Forces Act which is to be numbered as clause 60. This new clause amends section 201C(9) of the SAF Act to include the selected POSSPA powers for SAF servicemen to use when called upon during an activation order period. I refer Members to clause 60(e).
403,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,A new section 201C(9)(f) will be added which incorporates the types of POSSPA powers that SAF servicemen authorised by the Minister for Defence to support civilian authorities can exercise. These are no more than what is in clause 15(6) of the Bill if we did not amend that earlier. The limit on powers are as follows.
404,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Firstly, the powers can only be accessed when an Activation Order by the Minister for Home Affairs under POSSPA is in effect. If there is no Activation Order, the SAF servicemen cannot be authorised with these enhanced powers."
405,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Secondly, the SAF servicemen can only exercise powers that the Commissioner of Police requests SAF servicemen to exercise in order to assist Police during a serious incident. If the Commissioner of Police does not request for the military's assistance on certain duties, the SAF servicemen will not be able to exercise those powers."
406,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"Finally, the activation of the SAF servicemen and the exercise of powers is subject to the approval of the Minister for Defence, who remains the authority on whether or not to authorise SAF servicemen to be deployed and whether they should exercise POSSPA powers that the Commissioner of Police has requested that SAF servicemen in aid of the police officers deployed during the period of an Activation Order."
407,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,I next refer Members to the new clause 60(a) to (d) and (f).
408,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The amendments to section 201C(9)(b), (c), (d) and (e) have the effect of suspending these powers whenever similar powers under section 201C(9)(f) are exercised by the SAF servicemen activated to support the civilian authority using POSSPA powers."
409,PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL,,"The amendments made clear that the overlapping SAF Act powers are suspended when SAF servicemen are authorised with similar POSSPA powers under section 201C(9)(f).
