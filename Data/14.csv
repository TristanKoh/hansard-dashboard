1,TESTS ON AUTONOMOUS PUBLIC BUSES AND INCLUSION IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT MIX,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Transport),"The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Transport) : Mr Speaker, LTA has entered into partnerships with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and ST Kinetics (STK) to develop autonomous buses. These autonomous bus projects are progressing well, with NTU and STK on track to commence trials in 2019. The trials will initially be carried out in a controlled environment at the CETRAN Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Test Centre, before expanding into designated areas with lighter traffic such as NTU, CleanTech Park and Jurong Island. The lessons learnt will be useful when LTA subsequently deploys the autonomous buses to public roads."

We hope that the RFI returns will help us gauge industryâ€™s readiness and interest in AV pilot deployment, as well as give us inputs on concepts of operations such as management of AV fleets and infrastructural requirements. The pilot deployment is expected to provide important insights into commuter acceptance of AVs and how we can scale up their deployment across Singapore. "
