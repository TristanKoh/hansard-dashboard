0,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,"The Chairman: Head W, Ministry of Transport. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin. "
1,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir): Mr Chairman, I beg to move, ""That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the Estimates be reduced by $100."" "
2,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Chairman, before I kick off the Committee of Supply Debate for the Ministry of Transport, I believe I speak for all Members of this House when I wish Minister Khaw Boon Wan, a speedy recovery from his injury and we all look forward to the return of a formidable presence in this House very soon! [Applause]"
3,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Incidentally, Mr Chairman, as I cast my eyes across the floor, it suddenly dawn on me that with Minister Vivian temporarily in-charge, the Ministry of Transport is now helmed by three doctors, all with a sub-specialty in children. But, of course, we all agree that transport is no child's play. Let me carry on."
4,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I remember when I was appointed as GPC Chair for Transport in 2015, it was at a time when public satisfaction in our public transportation system, and in particular the MRT system, was at one of its lowest point.   "
5,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),, Being involved in GPC work for Transport then was quite a baptism of fire for me. 
6,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," On hindsight, it is understandable why public transportation, is an issue close to the hearts of Singaporeans. Transportation is a key pillar and enabler of our economy. It connects us domestically within Singapore and also to the rest of the world. It is the first thing we plan for when we leave home in the morning and the last thing we rely on to bring us safely home each night.    "
7,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"In recent years, MOT has had to deal with the rapid evolution and the changing landscape of transportation in Singapore.  "
8,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Advances in Transport Technology forces us to re-think and evolve the way we travel. Our domestic demographic and scarcity of land require us to adapt and constantly review our transportation system. In order to do this, the Government continues to invest heavily in transportation infrastructure and also to push the transport industry to its technological forefront.  "
9,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"These include, the rapid expansion and renewal of the MRT System, the support of technological disruptions to the transportation industry, the proliferation of Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs), e-Bikes and bike Sharing. Other new technologies such as driverless, automated vehicles are not far off on the horizon."
10,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The Budget numbers also reflect this. Ten years ago, in Financial Year 2009, MOT’s expenditure was approximately $5.4 billion. This year, the estimate is $11.5 billion. It has been a consistently increasing trend over the years.  "
11,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"With rapid changes however, difficulties and challenges will inevitably arise. "
12,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Some of these include, the rail reliability of our MRT system, the disruption that private hire cars brought to the point to point transportation market, safety issues between pedestrians and e-bikes and PMD users and even the irresponsible use and placement of shared bikes. These and other issues, when put together, often colour the public’s perception of the efficiency and reliability of our entire transportation network. "
13,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"In fairness, it is understandable how a new project or initiative, like the proliferation of e-bikes and PMDs, when viewed in isolation, can appear disjointed, or its challenges overwhelming. However, the recently released Land Transport Master Plan 2040 sets out the vision, I believe all Singaporeans can aspire and look forward to.  "
14,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"It is an ambitious plan – to build a transportation system that is inclusive, promotes healthy and safe journeys that can be completed within the target of 20-minute towns and 45-Minute City for all. This will require a seamless integration of public, active and shared transport network, that includes enhanced infrastructure to support all modes of transportation.  "
15,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Viewed in the lens of the vision provided by the Land Transport Master Plan 2040, the different projects and initiatives begin to complement each other better and the various pieces of the puzzle begin to fit together.  "
16,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,This bodes well for the future of transportation in Singapore and I am sure many of us are excited to see this vision be realised.  
17,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Sir, in terms of rail reliability, after three years of hard work, it appears that we may have turned a corner. The Mean Kilometres Between Failure (MKBF) for the entire MRT network increased from 181,000 train kilometres in 2017 to 690,000 train kilometres in 2018. The latest annual Public Transport Customer Satisfaction Survey showed an improvement in commuters’ satisfaction for MRT rising from 7.5, out of 10, in 2017 to 7.9 in 2018.  "
18,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"There is still much work to be done, with more expansion and renewal work to be done to our MRT system in the pipeline but for now, we can at least look forward to some stability in rail reliability as we continue to strive to improve.  "
19,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"This vision of building an inclusive, efficient and reliable domestic transport network, however, will come at a significant cost.  "
20,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,The ambitious targets outlined in the Land Transport Master Plan 2040 will not come cheap. Minister Khaw had previously shared with this House that the increased maintenance and renewal costs of our Train Systems at SMRT and SBST have resulted in significant losses for both companies in the past financial year.   
21,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,What does this mean for commuters? How will this cost burden affect the affordability of public transportation?
22,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I hope that MOT can share with this House, its plans on how it intends to manage these cost outlays efficiently and without an undue high cost burden on commuters.  "
23,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Sir, our domestic transportation system is, however, not the only focus of MOT’s attention.  "
24,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Internationally, Singapore has traditionally been a trading port which used its strategic location in the region and excellent connectivity to the rest of the world to position itself as an aviation and maritime hub.  "
25,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Over the years, Singapore has managed to create a world class infrastructure and regulatory environment at our port in Keppel and Changi Airport to spur growth in both the aviation and maritime industries. This not only contributed significantly to our budget but also created many jobs for Singaporeans.  "
26,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,These are key industries for Singapore.  
27,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Singapore cannot, therefore, afford to remain stagnant. As of now, we have moved our port from Keppel to Tuas and continue to improve and expand Changi Airport, with Terminal 5 as the next phase.  "
28,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We have also added the Jewel to Changi Airport. I must confess that before I visited the Jewel in early February this year, I had my doubts about the need for yet another shopping area at Changi Airport, given the shopping opportunities already available at the existing Terminals.  "
29,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Instead, what I found when I visited the Jewel was a beautifully designed garden concept recreational centre which complement the existing Airport and exemplifies our position as a garden city. It will also create many job opportunities for Singaporeans.  "
30,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,The Jewel will certainly be a delight for visitors and Singaporeans alike!  
31,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,We can be rightfully proud to be considered as one of the leading aviation and maritime hubs in the world. But we cannot rest on our laurels.  
32,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"As we move towards the future, we must ensure that our air and sea hubs continue to remain relevant and competitive."
33,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I would, therefore, like to invite the Acting Minister for Transport to share with us, the Ministry’s current and/or future plans on how we can continue to do so and also to address the other issues raised with regard to the future of Transportation in Singapore."
34,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Question proposed.
35,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong): Between the High Speed Rail (HSR) and Rapid Transit System (RTS) between Singapore and Johor, RTS will be more important as it will bring immediate relief to 300,000 people that cross the Causeway and second link on a daily basis. RTS will be able to carry 10,000 passengers per hour and will add capacity of 60,000 users crossing the causeway during peak hours .  "
36,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"RTS will be a people mover and it can significantly reduce the congestion at the Causeway and Second link. Currently, thousands of commuters are stuck in the congestion daily. The waste of time is causing losses in productivity."
37,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"With RTS, we will have less need for a third link. Thus, I will like to ask Acting Minister for Transport, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, how can we better engage Malaysia to shift the priority to RTS? What is the status of the RTS discussions now? Meanwhile, I will like to wish Minister Khaw Boon Wan a speedy recovery. "
38,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"With regard to Malaysia’s dispute with Singapore over the port limits, it has been nearly five months since Malaysia decided to expand its port limits into Singapore’s territories, which we disagree with. There seems to be no resolution yet. How would this affect the viability of our new Tuas port? What does it actually mean to us when waters within the port limits are not clearly defined? What impact would this have on Singapore’s maritime security in the short run and medium term? "
39,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"With regard to Malaysia’s dispute with Singapore over the usage of the Instrument Landing System (ILS), how would it affect the viability, safety or amount of air traffic which our new Seletar Airport can handle? What options do we have? "
40,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Chairman, discussion about the Singapore Flight Information Region (FIR) has come under the spotlight again, and in recent times, particularly with Malaysia’s intention to impose a military training area above Pasir Gudang, including its announcement to, I quote, “take back”, unquote, parts of the Singapore FIR from our management. Some quarters in Indonesia have similarly lobbied to reclaim sovereignty of the Singapore FIR over the Riau Islands for several years now. "
41,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Sir, FIR management is fundamentally about providing smooth and efficient air traffic control services with aviation safety being the topmost consideration, not sovereignty. Singapore has been known internationally to manage its FIR efficiently and impartially. Realigning parts of the Singapore FIR to mirror territorial boundaries would risk creating a severely fragmented airspace around Singapore with serious aviation safety risks for all users. With six airports including international airports in Johor, Batam and Bintan within 50 nautical miles of Singapore, a fragmented FIR will raise the risk of mishaps and accidents.  "
42,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"How does the Ministry currently manage flights bound for international airports in close proximity to Singapore, both inbound and outbound, and have our neighbours raised any issues with our management of the Singapore FIR thus far?"
43,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I would also like to seek an update on the Ministry's initiatives to better manage our airspace. Some years ago, a Centre of Excellence Air Traffic Management Fund of $200 million was set up. What has been the draw-down rate of this fund and what other measures does the Government have lined up to ensure that the Singapore maintains its status as a premier FIR manager. What has been the Government's experience working together with the UN weather agency, the World Meteorological Organisation since its establishment in Singapore in 2017 in benefiting the weather-sensitive aviation sector towards aviation safety? Finally, can the Ministry provide an update on the use of space-based very high frequency (VHF) communications for air traffic management in the Singapore FIR?"
44,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member): Chairman, MOT’s operating expenditures have risen quickly. This year’s budget projects operating expenditure just above $2 billion, up from less than $1 Billion a few years ago. Public transport services have benefited. In 2017, the Public Transport Council (PTC) reported that 94.5% were satisfied with public transport, significantly up from earlier years."
45,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"However, I am concerned that efficiency has suffered even as quality has improved. Based on data from LTA, under the Government Contracting Model (GCM), the fares we pay for buses only cover half of the operating costs today. Before the GCM, bus operators generally had fare revenues within a few percentage points of operating costs."
46,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"A similar story applies for train operations. Rail fare revenue was sufficient to cover operating costs, until recent years where losses have mounted due to maintenance expenditures. For the future, the Minister for Transport has said that fares may cover less than half of the operating expenses of the Thomson-East Coast Line."
47,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Chairman, there is a difference between public transport operations and fully private transport markets. In the private airline market, passengers buy the ticket that suits their needs. They choose based on price, value, convenience. Passengers do not buy business class if what they really want is economy."
48,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"But in public transport, we make these decisions for commuters, using public funds. The good thing is, we can give all Singaporeans high quality public transport even if the private market would not cater to them. But we have to be careful that we do not overpay for services that are not valued by the commuting public."
49,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I urge the Ministry to outline a comprehensive strategy for ensuring we have both value for money and high quality in public transport operations. For buses, at the operational level, what can we do, using route design, schedule optimization, and new technology such as on-demand services, to improve efficiency? On the strategic level, how are we evaluating the GCM and the contracting environment to improve competitiveness in tendering? For rail, can we make further use of time of travel shifting measures – such as peak and off-peak fares – to reduce costly excess capacity?"
50,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Most importantly, how can we engage the fare-paying public to give them a role in determining what services they value and what they do not want to pay for?"
51,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member): Since my Adjournment Motion speech on 15 January 2019, train delays are still taking place. For example, a train fault at Marsiling MRT station during the morning rush hour on 22 January 2019, lasted an hour, causing delays for commuters travelling in both directions. Just yesterday, there was a train fault on Downtown Line during the morning rush hour. Mr Chairman, more can still be done to minimise train delays of any lengths. Please allow me to revisit some of the points I made in my earlier Adjournment Motion speech."
52,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mean Kilometers Between Failure (MKBF) has been much talked. However these MKBF statistics while an internationally recognised indicator for rail reliability does not include delays of not more than five minutes. The Ministry has been silent about keeping track of the many delays of not more than five minutes. Delays whether long or short, have potential ripple effects that can snowball, meaning that these train delays affect other activities and constitute an economic costs to all involved. Singapore must continue to drive reliability, even higher. And as I have argued previously, we need to go beyond the current MKBF metrics in our reliability measurement approach. "
53,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The Network Capacity Factor (NCF) continues to be of concern. With rail capacity expected to double by 2030, the NCF will no doubt, be only rising, and help contribute to future, rising fare prices. We should review this. We must also pay close attention to the impact of such fare hikes on vulnerable groups."
54,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We need to enhance service quality including better punctuality for trains as well as more accurate and timely displays of trains delays. We also need to ensure better monitoring of service quality including through independently measured service quality experience by customers that could be affected in PTC's fare review formula, which is currently not the case."
55,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,The profitability of Public Transport Operator (PTO) should also be a factor in the PTC's fare review formula. The current productivity Extraction Factors should be redefined to account for PTO's profitability. Accounting for profitability will be more equitable for commuters. Retail operations from Operators will not be profitable without the infrastructure it operates in. Mandating the level of profits from retail operations to be added to the Railway Sinking Fund and the Rail Infrastructure Fund will move us towards a more equitable development of rail infrastructure in the long-term. Similar mechanisms can be done for bus infrastructure too.
56,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Finally, as per my Budget debate speech, I am concern as to how the huge increase in diesel excise tax will have implications for our commuters and fares. Most taxis and public buses are still running on diesel; and conversion to hybrid or electric options will still take quite a few more years for the taxis and even longer time for the buses. The short-term rebates will likely not be enough to stop Operators passing the costs to consumers. Since the Government did not push for the conversion to start earlier, it should give more reasonable timelines for bus and taxi companies to convert to to hybrid or electric options fully before applying the tax increased. "
57,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"If the Government truly believes in environmental conservation, it should attend more to the electric vehicle and charging stations availability side of the equation. To focus minds on this agenda, I echo my colleague, Leon Perera's call for the Government to set future dateline for a total fossil fuel vehicles banned, like what the United Kingdom and France has done. Perhaps that is the longer term approach that Singapore can take to mitigate environmental concerns."
58,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Arasu Duraisamy (Nominated Member),"Mr Arasu Duraisamy (Nominated Member): Chairman Sir, I would first like to declare my interest as the General Secretary of Singapore Port workers union and also a member of Public Transport Council (PTC). Tuas South is currently being developed for existing and new businesses. Businesses such as the Tuas Mega Port, Shipbuilding industry, Biomedical Park, Electronics firms, Logistic and cold chain companies, Petrochemical companies among others. These are mainly companies with decent pay, decent work environment and some even utilising the state of the art technologies. These are good jobs. Jobs we want Singaporeans will be gainfully employed in. The challenge is: how do we attract Singaporeans to go there to work. "
59,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I recalled in our early years of industrialisation, the Government faced the same but different challenge. Enticing Singaporeans to take up employment in the Jurong Industrial Estate was also no easy feat; despite high unemployment then. Besides building public housing in Jurong, one of the things done then was to develop a public transport system to facilitate Singaporeans from other parts of the country to commute to work daily. Hence the comprehensive shuttle and trunk services; in addition to company-provided transport."
60,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"What about Tuas South? As it is, the area is rather remote to most Singaporeans. In terms of accessibility, Malaysian workers have it better compared to the locals, due to the proximity of the Tuas Second link. The nearest MRT station is Tuas West station. The distance from Tuas West station to Tuas Port Terminal Phase 1 is approximately 12 km to 13 km, with a travelling time of about 20 minutes. Currently, there is one feeder bus service from Tuas Bus Terminal serving Tuas South Ave 14. Taking a train from Ang Mo Kio to Tuas West Station, the travelling time is about 65 minutes, not factoring the time taken to travel from home to station and station to the work area. The duration is no means short for the workers who have to commute daily. "
61,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Such long distance will deter Singaporeans staying in the northern, eastern and central areas from wanting to work in Tuas South. I understand employers had a hard time getting local Singaporeans to work in Tuas area. With the companies providing transport the situation was slightly better, and it improved with the opening of the Tuas West extension line. I encountered a similar situation when the port moved to Pasir Panjang, and the workers had some challenge when transferred to the new terminals, till the opening of the Circle Line. Readily available public transport, especially our MRT train services, is a critical factor to be considered to facilitate Singaporeans to work in Tuas South area, notably when the area is being developed to provide good employment opportunities."
62,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"While businesses might provide transport for their workers, not all might do so. Singaporeans will use other means to travel to work in order to save time, and this poses a risk, especially travelling, long distance after completing the graveyard shift. Sir, I have handled cases of Malaysian union members who were involved in fatal traffic accidents after commuting from their home or while heading back home after work. Fatigue was one of the reasons. "
63,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Having to commute daily to work for more than 90 minutes back and forth can take a toll and certainly not what we want to subject our fellow Singaporeans to. I would humbly request the Minister of Transport to do a feasibility study on building an MRT line to Tuas South. This line can run via Jurong island as there is also a need for transport for workers working over there. If LTA aims to ensure the maximum of 45 minutes of travelling time between one’s home and work at Shenton Way, I do not see why the Government cannot consider it for workers working in an area where the future of work is."
64,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"There is no denying, that the cost of building and operating an MRT line will be high and there is always an issue of ridership, at least till the place is fully developed and bustling with activities. Nevertheless, I humbly believe it is a chicken and egg problem. Without easy accessibility to an efficient public transport, Singaporeans will find it challenging take up employment in Tuas South. Businesses will find it difficult to expand or gear up their activities due to human resource constrains. Hence the ridership may not reach the so-called optimal number. "
65,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Surely when we first embarked on industrialisation in Jurong town, ridership was not the top priority or consideration when developing the transport system. It was about providing a public transport service to facilitate Singaporeans seeking employment in Jurong. For the same reason, I urge the Government to continue to do likewise and ensure every Singaporean who takes up employment in Tuas South area can do so with a safe, comfortable and efficient transport service. It is not only about the companies and businesses in Tuas South. It is about every worker and “Every Worker Matters”."
66,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,"The Chairman: Ms Low Yen Ling, you can take your two cuts together. "
67,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling),"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling): Thank you, Chairman. Chairman, today we have about 228 km of rapid rail tracks, a growth of 14% from 2017. Ridership has risen by over 5% to 3.5 million rides taking place on the MRT and LRT each day. More than 7.5 Million commuters use the bus or train each day and that is a jump of almost 4% from 2017."
68,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,I would like to thank and commend the hard work and perseverance of MOT and LTA for all the improvements that they have made to our transport network and train connectivity. The Ministry constantly seeks to better understand commuters and plan our transport systems for future needs.  
69,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Recently, it released the Transport Master Plan 2040 which had sought more than 7,000 views from the public on what they valued in their travel. According to the surveys, commuters prized convenience most, followed by connectivity and fast travel time. Proximity to bus stops and MRT stations, as well as ease of transferring from one transport mode to another also featured prominently in the feedback. "
70,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"As a result, LTA released its latest transport goals that envision healthy and safe 20-minute towns and a 45-Minute City for Singapore by year 2040. In line with this, the Advisory Panel for the Master Plan made these recommendations:"
71,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"(a) To offer commuters more public, active and shared modes of transport;"
72,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"(b) To develop a more inclusive transport system for families, elderly and persons with disabilities (PWDs); and"
73,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,(c) To create journeys for healthier lifestyles and a more liveable Singapore.
74,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We welcome all these goals and hope that the aims of the 2040 Master Plan will translate to a change in status for the currently under-served Hume area. Without an MRT station, the Master Plan can only be a dream for the residents staying in and around Hume. Just like the survey respondents, Hume residents too place top value on convenience, connectivity and shorter travelling times."
75,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," However, the residents staying in and around Hume are presently caught in a long 2.6 km un-served stretch of tracks between Hillview MRT Station and Beauty World MRT Station. This distance of 2.6 km is more than double the average 1.1 km found between most train stations. Each time a Hume resident wants to take the Downtown Line, it entails a detour backwards to Hillview or to Beauty World, or a squeeze onto the crowded buses at peak hours."
76,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Travelling times are currently far from ideal. For example, to get to Hillview MRT station, Hume residents need to ""backtrack"" in their bus routes, and peak hour travel could mean longer waiting times. Residents heading to town via Beauty World MRT Station are often subject to an extended wait because most buses plying Upper Bukit Timah Road are full by the time they reach Bukit Gombak. Residents could spend 15 minutes or more before being able to squeeze up a bus, and this really means that the vision of a 45-minute city is really beyond their reach."
77,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Hence, I would like to strongly urge MOT/LTA not to leave Hume out of the new Master Plan. Build the MRT station now at Hume, so that the residents there can have a chance to be part of the new transport goals."
78,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," With an MRT station at Hume, residents will be placed on track the new Master Plan. With seamless multi-modes of transport, their travel times will be reduced. Children and elderly residents, as well as residents with disabilities, would be able to enjoy safer travels with an inclusive train transport system, right from their estate."
79,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Constructing the Hume MRT station will create journeys that promote healthier lifestyles – one objective of the new Master Plan – and a more liveable Singapore. This is a key objective of the Master Plan. A new MRT station in Hume will certainly bring the people closer to the planned Rail Corridor. The development has historical significance and plenty of recreational potential. It has eight distinctively-themed stretches along its 24 km-long Corridor and 10 community nodes offering differentiated experiences. So, I was very heartened to hear Minister Desmond Lee's update during MND COS yesterday to know that the former Bukit Timah Fire Station will be developed into a visitor centre and a recreational node. We have been broaching on the ground in Bukit Gombak with MND, URA on this possibility and I am very happy that Minister Desmond Lee shared that this will come to fruition in the former Bukit Timah Fire Station soon."
80,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Now, by providing access to the historical site, Hume MRT Station will strengthen the residents' sense of local identity and enhance Singaporeans' appreciation of our past in that belt. So, we hope that the Ministry will see different possibilities that an MRT station in Hume can offer."
81,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Today, rail stations have the potential to become destinations and lifestyle centres that blend commuting with exercise, community with recreation, and actually community with even understanding history. People are increasingly using stations not just as a transport node, but also as places for leisure and social activities."
82,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"For example, the iconic New York Grand Central Terminal and London’s St Pancras Station. They are crowd pleasers; they draw a lot of traffic to those stations with their history, architecture, shopping and also dining choices. With the Rail Corridor in its backyard, Hume MRT station can eventually evolve into an exciting node promoting healthy lifestyles and a highly liveable Bukit Gombak in South West district."
83,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Chairman, as I have illustrated, we have a strong and also a compelling case for building Hume MRT station. I strongly urge MOT and LTA to consider making investments in transportation that has widespread benefits. When transport systems are efficient and under-served gaps are being closed, they can provide social and economic opportunities that lead to positive multiplier effects in that area. For example, higher footfall or even tourism, new businesses, and also healthier and better lifestyles. Conversely, when transport systems are lacking, they lead to reduced or missed opportunities, and can lead to lower quality of life."
84,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," In fact, in the last seven years – this is the eighth year I am making a case for Hume MRT station – and I remember last year, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan – we all wish him a speedy and smooth recovery – had responded to me in Parliament last year with the kind assurance that the Ministry is committed to opening Hume MRT station in good time and in pace with potential growth in ridership and development of the Hume area. Now with plans for the development of the Rail Corridor, the former Bukit Timah Fire Station, LTA’s vision of a 45-minute city, the time has come now to approve the construction of Hume MRT station and translate the hopes of the residents staying in and around Hume into reality."
85,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Chairman, like many urban cities, we constantly face the challenges of growing transport needs and development, as well as physical space constraints on our island-state."
86,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," In Bukit Gombak, we have benefited from MOT and LTA’s plan to create a people-centred transport system in Singapore. Since the Downtown line started a few years back, our residents’ travelling time into the city has been reduced significantly. Commuting is now more pleasant than before. The provision of covered walkway around our constituency has enhanced our journeys and last mile connection. In fact, some of the residents said they leave their car at home and take the train during the weekday to work. "
87,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I wish to register my heartfelt appreciation and gratitude to the MOT and LTA for their hard work and patience in listening to all our transport requests. The numerous site visits and discussions have indeed resulted in improving the commuting experience in Bukit Gombak. Through the years, we have improved our roads and walkways, as well as introduced new bus services."
88,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," The 1,066 metres of covered walkway on one side at Hillview Avenue, from Hillview Park all the way to Hillview Green and now extending to Lam Soon Building, has served our residents well. However, residents staying on the opposite side of Hillview Avenue, from Hillview Peak all the way to Hillview Crescent, they are feeling the heat, especially now, in their commute to the bus stop or as they walk up to Hillview MRT station. We hope LTA would consider extending the last mile connection to these residents with the construction of a sheltered walkway."
89,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Secondly, residents from Keat Hong Colours, and this is a new BTO estate, are having to travel a greater distance to their nearest bus stop since Bus Service 308 was replaced by the route of Bus Service 991. As a result of this change in bus service, residents no longer have a direct link to Chua Chu Kang MRT station and bus interchange, as well as important amenities like the Choa Chu Kang Polyclinic, Teck Whye Shopping Centre and nearby markets. "
90,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," This situation can be changed if the LTA could review Bus 991 bus route to meet these unmet needs. In addition, there is now a distance of about 280 metres between the ""old 308 bus top"", which is bus stop No 44879, and the ""new 991 bus stop"", which is bus stop No 44889 – 280 metres between these two bus stops. We would like to request LTA, please close the gap with a sheltered walkway to serve these Keat Hong Axis and Colors residents."
91,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Thirdly, we hope that the Ministry will continue to look into transport enhancement for Bukit Gombak as our town grows in size and network. Come 2023, the new NS Hub will be built in Bukit Gombak, near Hillview and Gombak Drive. I would like to congratulate Defence Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen and his ministry on the decision to bring all services under one roof for the NS community."
92,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),, Bukit Gombak is no stranger to MINDEF. It is home to many army personnel at the Gombak camp and we are glad that the upcoming NS Hub in our vicinity will serve our NSmen as well.
93,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," While we look forward to the arrival of NS Hub in four years' time, we are also mindful of the transport considerations as more traffic, people and movement are anticipated to come into Bukit Gombak. "
94,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," As I had highlighted in my COS speech on transport in the last few years, a crucial transport link is needed to connect the Hillview area and the Bukit Gombak Neighbourhood Centre. Currently, residents from the Bukit Gombak Neighbourbood Centre who want to use the Downtown Line MRT Station, although it is just about one km away, they would have to take two buses to get to the Hillview MRT station."
95,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," It is the same situation if they wish to get to our newly completed Community Club (CC), or if they wish to shop at the fairly new HillV2 mall. Having to change buses adds precious minutes to their travelling and waiting time within the constituency. Likewise, residents staying at the Hillview area do not have a direct bus to the Bukit Gombak Neighbourhood Centre that has more than 10 coffeeshops and more than 108 HDB shops for them to do their marketing and also buying of groceries."
96,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," This lack of community coverage and connection within the constituency actually draws an invisible line across our estate that has several ""‘centres of gravity"" or hubs. Without direct bus coverage, the flow of movement, the flow of people between the two sides of Bukit Gombak is somewhat hampered."
97,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," A direct bus link would offer greater chances for our residents, especially from the largely private estate of Hillview to go to Bukit Gombak Neighbourhood Centre where the markets, HDB estate and shops are; and vice versa, for residents staying at the Bukit Gombak area to easily access HillV2 mall and also to enjoy the facilities at our Hillview Community Club. As the node for our constituency activities and events, the CC especially, should be made easily accessible to all our residents, especially residents who rely on public transport."
98,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," So, Chairman, we need a people-centred transport system for community bonding and integration in our estate. Let not the lack of public transport be a hindrance to bringing residents staying in the same constituency closer together."
99,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," We hope that LTA will re-examine the lack of bus connectivity between Bukit Gombak Neighbourhood Centre and the Hillview areas and provide buses to link up our estate. This need has become more urgent now, with the location of NS Hub in our backyard. by year 2023. NS men accessing the hub from Bukit Gombak side will benefit from the direct buses heading towards Hillview area."
100,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," In addition, connecting the Hillview and Gombak areas to the North South line and Downtown line respectively will certainly expand transport options and encourage more of Bukit Gombak residents to go car-lite and bring us closer to green and sustainable living."
101,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Mr Ang Wei Neng. You may take your next three cuts together.
102,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong): Chairman, as we expand the rail network to 360 km by 2030, we will have to build up sufficient local expertise to build tunnel, railway, MRT stations as well as maintaining the Train rolling stock and other components."
103,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Last year, I urged MOT to consider nurturing local expertise to build and maintain MRT system. A good comparison is Hong Kong MTR. Hong Kong has acquired sufficient expertise in building, maintaining and operating their train system so much so that they are winning a lot of contracts overseas. How about us?"
104,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I understand LTA is trying hard, for instance, the contract to build the Sungei Bedok MRT station and its tunnels was awarded to local firm KTC Civil Engineering and Construction. But more can be done."
105,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"In many countries, large Government projects typically have offset obligation of certain percentage, some as high as 50%, to require the foreign contractor to partner and allocate works to local companies. Very often, such scheme also involves knowledge transfer.  "
106,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I am not advocating imposing offset obligation immediately. However, could we not move in this direction? As part of the evaluation criteria for awarding large MRT contracts, I hope LTA can consider mandating the tenderers to showcase their plan to better engage local contractors and facilitate technology transfers.  "
107,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The Panel for the Land Transport Masterplan 2040 envisioned that Singaporeans would be able to reach neighbourhood town within 20 minutes, and the city within 45 minutes, by 2040. And this appears very great but 2040 appears quite far away.  "
108,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"MOT has announced that by 2030, eight in 10 households will be within 10-minute walk of MRT station as our rail network increased to 360 km by then. Is this timeline still on track? I suppose rail network will be the cornerstone, the backbone and pillar of the Land Transport Masterplan 2040. Thus, why cannot we reach the vision of 45-Minute City by 2030? What will be the additional significant improvements to land transport that MOT is thinking about between 2030 and 2040?  "
109,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"What is the current reality? How many Singaporeans can now travel to city within 45 minutes? Is it 25%, 50% or 75%? How many households are now staying within 10-minute walk of train station?  "
110,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"For people who are staying within 10-minute walk of the train station near their home and their workplace is also within 10-minute walk to a train station, what is the current, average and median and 90th percentile of travelling time to city? Is it already less than 45 minutes? If not, what are the obstacles that are preventing them from doing so? "
111,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"And with the reality check, there can be better understanding of the current constraints that both MOT and Singaporeans can work together to reach the 2040 vision. If there are obstacles, we need to remove the obstacles together. If we need to change a mindset to better embrace public transport and shared transportation, let us work out the strategy together. "
112,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I will first like to declare my interest as the chief executive officer of ComfortDelGro's taxi business. In the past few years, the Point to Point or P2P transport sector has been heavily disrupted by new players, new technology and new money. "
113,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The recent PTC survey showed that consumers had no clear preference between private-hire cars and taxis. This shows that both sectors are serving largely the same group of people. In the last few years, the authority has adopted a wait-and-see approach pertaining to the ride hailing sector. At the same time, the authority continues to regulate the taxi sector as tight as before and this has created some distortions and disruptions to the market. Let me explain."
114,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Before the entry of private-hire cars, we have 28,000 taxis but this number is not enough to meet the peak hour demand, especially during rainy days. Today, we have 22,000 taxis estimated and 44,000 private-hire cars, and these 66,000 vehicles still cannot meet the peak hour demands. And that is why commuters are experiencing surge pricing, which can be a few times the taxi metered fare, during peak hours. During off-peak, then there are too many vehicles for hire.  "
115,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"In an era of no regulation for the ride hailing sector, the ride hailing company is buying market share by subsidising fare through generous promotion codes – burning money; burning investors' money. Commuters are happy. Drivers are also happy because they are getting generous incentives from the ride hailing company and these incentives can be more than the fares they collected. And, what is the result?  "
116,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The result is that we have one company now dominating the vehicle booking market in Singapore and the fares start to rise as compared to days with high promotion codes. In recent days, you can also see that a player unilaterally imposing cancellation charges and location surcharge without the need of obtaining approval from the authority. So, this is the case of winner takes all. "
117,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"In the short run, commuters cheer the promotion codes. Certain party also urges the taxi drivers to drive for ride hailing company to enjoy the incentives. In the long run, when one winner takes all, it will be bad for both the commuters and the drivers. "
118,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,And this is why the authorities see the need to intervene the P2P transport sector.  
119,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"And, the question is how? I will suggest three principles or rather three areas where we need to pay more attention."
120,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Firstly, on price. During peak hours, it is widely reported that surge pricing can be a few times the taxi metered fare. Should there be a cap? On the contrary, very low peak hour fares will also drive the supply away. So, we need a balance. "
121,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Secondly, on availability. Today, ride hailing companies claim that their cater rate can be almost 100%. And this is because when you ask for private car, and it can come to you but it could be 20 minutes or more. For taxi companies, on the other hand, they have to ensure that their taxis arrive within 10 minutes most of the time based on current regulation.  "
122,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"So, what should be the acceptable definition of vehicle availability? This is where public and commuters need to be consulted.  "
123,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"And thirdly, on safety. To ensure public safety, taxis are subjected to six-monthly inspection and taxi drivers have to be more than 30 years old, a proxy of how experienced a driver could be. Private-hire cars are not subjected to the same regulations today. Safety is important and I hope that the authority can take that into consideration.  "
124,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"In short, I agree that a review on the P2P transport sector is timely. "
125,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio): Chairman, I would like to declare my interest as the union representative for the private-hire drivers as well as the taxi drivers."
126,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The Government had taken a light touch regulatory approach towards ride-hailing apps. There are now, some say 60,000, some say 40,000 private hire vehicles and about 20,000 taxis on the road. Commuters have more choices and more workers have become vocational drivers."
127,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I have previously called for a review of the regulations for private hire and taxi operators to first better safeguard interests of commuters, second, ensure fair competition, and third, offer better welfare for the drivers. "
128,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,An example was the initial partnership of Uber and ComfortDelGro (CDG) and a subsequent merger of Uber and Grab in 2018. Many feared then that it will lead to excessive power owned by one big player. I am glad that the authority has announced earlier that exclusivity by operators will not be allowed. Drivers must be allowed to choose jobs from any platforms or arrangements. 
129,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,We should therefore situations where operators cause unnecessary anxiety among drivers by telling them that they will not cover drivers' insurance if anything happens while they fetch passengers using another service platform. We should also avoid operators working together to co-share commission and end up competing less with one another.
130,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Decisions by operators have a big impact on consumers' options and drivers' livelihood. In fact, operators can unilaterally decide to ban or suspend drivers according to their own rules. As drivers are self-employed, the Employment Act does not apply to them and there have limited recourse. "
131,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We propose that the Ministry form tripartite workgroups to agree on hiring terms among other issues to be addressed. This is in tandem with the Ministry of Manpower's proposed recommendations for Self-Employed Persons (SEP). In fact, we already have such tripartite workgroup for taxi drivers, taxi operators and the LTA."
132,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Ride hailing operators also have light assets, making it easy for them to suddenly exit to the detriment of drivers, commuters and their own employees. The sudden exit of Uber was a case in point. Ride hailing operators also collect monies on behalf of drivers and any delay in payments will not be fair to the drivers. Hence, the new licensure should ensure that there are safeguards such as security deposits or minimum payment period by the operators."
133,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Chairman, the P2P sector also includes the traditional limousine drivers and others who belong to informal networks. I have met many of them throughout the last few years. Many operate on varying degrees of matching and driving as a service. Drivers, so called ""page out"" jobs from their regular clients to other members when they are unable to fulfill them. "
134,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Drivers in this group have expressed serious concerns if the regulations are onerous.
135,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Chairman, the groups are home-grown. The authority had taken a light touch regulatory approach for foreign new entrants like Uber and Grab for several years. Look how far these operators have come and how much they have benefited. We should therefore provide similar leeway to our local groups to operate alongside these bigwigs."
136,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"As it is, the growth in commuters is slowing. I estimate about 1.2 million daily hired trips now compared to about a million five years ago. But we have now about 130,000 taxi and private hire vocational license holders. It appears that too many drivers are fighting for a limited pie."
137,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Should we consider capping the number of such vehicles? Should we not have more modes of leasing like hourly rental? Should the age of new taxi and private hire drivers not be raised to prevent an over-supply situation?
138,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,The members of the associations have met with Senior Minister of State Janil on the proposed recommendations and we will continue to have such dialogues with him to ensure that our commuters and drivers will be safeguarded.
139,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira: Chairman, the market for urban mobility has changed significantly. Innovations such as private-hire ride hailing and bicycle sharing have made commuting easier and faster. At the same time, there have been growing pains, ranging from market dominance in ride-hailing, to indiscriminate parking of shared bicycles, and unrecoverable debts from failed start-ups."
140,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The Government's light-touch approach has helped these markets grow. But at times, the locus of regulation has been unclear. For example, in ride-hailing, today LTA handles driver licensing, while the CCCS oversees market conduct due to the recent Grab-Uber merger. The Public Transport Council, meanwhile, has no statutory authority over ride-hailing and personal mobility device services."
141,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"What are the Ministry's plans to design more integrated and holistic regulation for urban mobility services? Such services are parts of the broader public transport eco-system. Many operators see the potential for vertical integration of services from public transport, to point-to-point, to personal mobility devices. To achieve the LTMP 2040 target of nine in 10 journeys using public, active, and shared modes of transport, regulation should take a broader view."
142,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Further, could the PTC's statutory authority be widened to serve as a one-stop shop to safeguard the interests of commuters and stakeholders in the broader public transport eco-system?"
143,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,"The Chairman: Mr Melvin Yong, you can take your two cuts together."
144,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar): Chairman, technological advances will allow us to reinvent and re-imagine our land transport system.One good example is the introduction of on-demand public buses."
145,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The LTA recently launched a trial of On-Demand Public Bus (ODPB) services which allow commuters to request pick-ups and drop-offs at any bus-stop within defined areas, using a mobile application. The intention of such a trial is to evaluate the feasibility of operating public bus service with routes and schedules based on real-time commuter demand instead of following current fixed routes and pre-determined timetables. Last week, LTA announced that about 6,000 trips have been taken in the first two months of the trial with about 20,000 app downloads."
146,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I recently visited Shenton Way Bus Terminal to learn how the trial at Marina Downtown area has been progressing and to also talk to our bus workers operating the service. From what I observed, there are clear benefits to this system. By being more responsive to the real-time changes in commuter demand, we can reduce empty mileage quite significantly. "
147,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Currently, the trial operates only during off-peak hours. I would like to ask can the Ministry extend the trial to peak hours to test if the benefits apply as well. I would also like to suggest for the system to incorporate the use of virtual bus-stops. With technology, we can increase convenience for commuters by allowing them to select their pick-up and drop-off points along certain designated zones instead of confining to current traditional bus-stops."
148,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The On-Demand Public Bus concept will certainly be useful in areas where there is low financial viability to deploy fixed and scheduled buses due to a low population density, such as private landed estates of which I have plenty in my constituency. I hope that the Ministry can consider extending the On-Demand Public Bus trial to the Dunearn and Bukit Timah estates which are currently located within my constituency. There are many elderly residents living in these areas and having such a service would be useful for those who may find that the nearest bus-stop or MRT station is quite a distance to walk."
149,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Finally, the On-Demand Public Bus concept is not entirely flawless. Some of the bus captains I spoke to shared that they were not able to adapt well to the rigours of being always on demand. They preferred to work on fixed and scheduled routes. I therefore urge the Ministry to also consider drivers' stress, drivers' fatigue and work with the union and the public transport operators to look after the needs of our bus drivers who are plying on such On-Demand Public Buses."
150,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I sit on the Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP) Advisory Panel and we have recently announced our recommendations on the Land Transport Master Plan 2040. Harnessing technology will be key to realising some of the recommendations meet by the Panel. However, the flipside of harnessing that very same technology will have the potential disruptions to the livelihoods of many of our public transport workers. Here, I declare my interest as the executive secretary of the National Transport Workers Union and I would like to ask the Ministry to shed more light on the impact of Land Transport Master Plan 2040 recommendation on public transport workers."
151,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Are there plans to ensure that our public transport workers are ready to embrace Artificial Intelligence and digitalisation? The union stands ready to work with the Ministry and the transport operators to help our workers keep up with technology changes and ensure that they are well-prepared to handle future challenges in this sector, but we need the Government's support for this."
152,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"One key technology that Singapore has been exploring in recent years is the use of autonomous vehicles. There are several ongoing trials for autonomous vehicles, including autonomous buses. With the most recent being NTU's collaboration with Volvo to test self-driving electric buses in actual traffic conditions. At a recent focus group discussion, where Senior Minister of State Janil and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng were also present, our public transport workers and union leaders expressed strong concerns over the uncertainty of their jobs due to the impending adoption of autonomous buses. In fact, I have also raised these concerns at every COS since 2017. "
153,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We need to take action sooner, rather than later, to help our public transport workers transition into a driverless world. There are more than 10,000 bus captains, of whom many have been driving as a livelihood for decades. I therefore urge the Ministry to set up a tripartite committee, to work with the union and the transport operators, to oversee the impact of the development of autonomous vehicles on transport workers in Singapore."
154,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,
155,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines): Mr Chairman, as we move towards a car-lite society the Government needs to ensure that our public transport is reliable, efficient, extensively connected and cost effective. Sir, there has been an emphasis on last mile connectivity by foot, bus, PMDs, bicycles and so on. However, residents often complain of pathways being unsafe because of the different devices on it, and parents and grandparents still feel that they cannot hold the hands of the children as it is not safe. It is safe for the children to walk in front of them. "
156,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Can the Ministry share on their enforcement actions, as staff strength to make our pathways safer? Last year, an SBS Transit Bus collided with SMRT bus along Jalan Jurong Kechil, leaving 33 people injured. And LTA released a statement emphasising that safety is of paramount important. I would like to ask the Minister to give an update and provide statistics on past safety breaches for our public transport system.  "
157,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang): Chairman, at last year's Committee of Supply (COS), many Members of Parliament spoke up about the dangers caused by speeding e-scooters and indiscriminate parking by users of bike-sharing services. Since then, the speed limit of 15 km/h for e-scooters on footpaths has been reduced to 10km/h and owners of e-scooters are required to register their e-scooters."
158,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"A year is a long time for bike sharing firms, oBike has gone under and Ofo bike has been suspended for failing to meet the new requirements to prevent indiscriminate parking. While bike-sharing companies had contributed to much disamenities, they have also played an important role in terms of last mile connectivity. With the demise of oBike and Ofo, possibly the two operators with the largest fleet of bikes, what is the Ministry doing to ensure that last mile connectivity is not compromised?"
159,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Dr Lam Pin Min. 
160,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min),"The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min): Mr Chairman, I agree with Mr Sitoh Yih Pin wholeheartedly that the works of the Transport Ministry is no child's play. It affects the lives of thousands and millions of Singaporeans on a daily basis. Speaking as a pediatric ophthalmologist and I believe my fellow pediatric colleagues will agree that besides treating or operating on a patient who is a child, what is most important is to win the confidence and trust of the parents who put the lives and well-being of their precious one in our hands. Similarly, as we aspire to make our public transport system world class, we need to gain the confidence and trust of Singaporeans. "
161,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"For example, Singaporeans have made personal sacrifices such as during the early closure and late opening, while we step up maintenance and upgrading works for the rail system. I want to thank Singaporeans for their understanding. It is a delicate balance. We must not rest on our laurels, and we will continue to work hard at it.  "
162,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Chairman, may I have your permission for slides to be displayed during MOT's replies to Members?"
163,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,"The Chairman: Yes, please. [Slides were shown to hon Members.]"
164,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Lam Pin Min,"Dr Lam Pin Min: Mr Chairman, Members have raised good questions about MOT's work across air, sea and land transport. Together, Acting Minister for Transport Vivian Balakrishnan, Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng and I will address the queries in three themes."
165,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"First, Connecting Singapore to the World. Changi Airport and our port play an important role in making Singapore a global city and a vibrant economic hub. For this theme, I will speak on how we are strengthening connectivity with ASEAN and working with international organisations, as well as investing in our air and sea hubs. In addition to discussing domestic public transport issues, Acting Minister for Transport Vivian Balakrishnan will also address Members' questions on bilateral issues with Malaysia."
166,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Second, Cultivating Innovation and Creating Opportunities for All. Embracing technology and innovation will be key in strengthening our transport sectors, and creating opportunities for Singaporeans. I will share on some technologies we are harnessing in the aviation and maritime domains. Back home, we are embracing innovative commuting options such as private hire cars and active mobility devices. Senior Minister of State Janil will speak on our plans to regulate the point-to-point sector, and I will speak on active mobility."
167,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Third, Co-Creating with Singaporeans, Bringing Singapore Together. Last year, we started work on the next Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP) to set out the vision for our land transport system in 2040. We have consulted widely to co-create a vision with Singaporeans and build a land transport system which meets the diverse needs of Singaporeans. Senior Minister of State Janil will elaborate on the LTMP 2040 and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey will share how we are creating an inclusive land transport system for all."
168,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Let me now turn to the first theme. Connecting Singapore to the World. This year, we mark the Singapore Bicentennial. But even before 1819, there were already records of Singapore being a thriving sea port. We were a location where East meets West, and for many centuries an important port for trading valuable spices like pepper and nutmeg."
169,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"After Independence, our pioneers turned our location into an advantage. They built the first container terminal in Southeast Asia at Tanjong Pagar in 1972, despite the uncertainty that containerisation would even take off. Not long after, against the consultants' recommendations, they shifted our international airport from Paya Lebar to Changi, to accommodate the future expansion of the airport. Today, our buzzing sea port and Changi Airport are all part and parcel of the Singapore identity."
170,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"But we cannot take what we have for granted. As Mr Sitoh Yih Pin rightly noted, there is much to be done for our air and sea hubs to remain relevant and competitive in the long term."
171,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"First, aviation and maritime are international businesses. The flow of goods and people is dependent on good connectivity between different regions. A dense network of Southeast Asia nodes will enable all of us to ride on Asia's growth together. For example, since the first ASEAN Air Services Agreement was signed in 2009 to liberalise air rights for ASEAN airlines for flights within ASEAN, passenger traffic within ASEAN has grown by more than 90%. This has coincided with a period of strong growth in ASEAN tourism."
172,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The expansion of connectivity beyond ASEAN will further stimulate tourism growth. Since the signing of the ASEAN-China Air Transport Agreement in 2011, direct links have increased more than fivefold to over 500, providing more flexible and convenient travel options between China and Southeast Asia. In 2018, the number of Chinese tourists to Southeast Asia reached 25 million, up from 10 million before the Agreement. For Singapore, the number of Chinese tourists visiting Singapore grew from 1.6 million to 3.4 million. Singapore's extensive air links to China also connect Chinese passengers to the region – the Singapore/Malaysia/Thailand tour itinerary (新马泰游) is a popular one. The Singapore Tourism Board, Changi Airport Group and Royal Caribbean International also have a tripartite partnership to sail Chinese Fly-Cruise tourists from Singapore to Southeast Asia."
173,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,This is why Singapore participates actively in establishing stronger links between the region and the rest of the world.
174,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"There are on-going negotiations on air transport agreements between ASEAN and the European Union, and between ASEAN and Japan. These agreements would further boost economic ties, and enable the aviation industries of these countries to better tap on the Asia-Pacific market."
175,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Similarly, maritime connectivity plays an important role in supporting the growing region. Over the past decade, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has recorded a steady rise in the Liner Shipping Connectivity Index scores of ASEAN countries. This means that the region is increasingly connected to the global shipping network. Singapore will continue to play our part. We have built a reliable and densely connected network, by anchoring key shipping lines and alliances that ply the main shipping route from Asia to Europe."
176,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Together with our strong complementary feeder network to ASEAN ports, we ensure that goods manufactured in Southeast Asia can be delivered efficiently worldwide. We are also developing new and efficient maritime trade routes. The New International Land Sea Trade Corridor under the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative, also known as CCI-ILSTC, is one example. This new route helps businesses in Southeast Asia access Chinese markets more efficiently. For example, Indonesian paper pulp is traditionally shipped via bulk to Jiangsu and conveyed by barge into Chongqing. Now, they can be containerised and transported through the CCI-ILSTC, saving time and money for businesses."
177,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Chairman, we must also grow our connectivity in a sustainable way. In this regard, Singapore contributes actively to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and International Maritime Organization (IMO), to play our part in strengthening international aviation and maritime systems."
178,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"For example, Singapore is supportive of the IMO's efforts to address the environmental impact caused by ship emissions. We will be implementing the 0.5% sulphur emission cap, and preparing our port to supply liquefied natural gas as a clean marine fuel by 2020. On the aviation front, Singapore contributed extensively to ICAO's efforts in addressing international aviation carbon dioxide emissions through the implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This global initiative will help ICAO achieve its aspirational goal of carbon-neutral growth from 2020."
179,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"At the same time, we are working with ASEAN to push for our collective interest at international platforms. For example, Singapore is now collaborating with Malaysia and Indonesia to implement a ""Same Risk Area"" for ballast water management, following IMO's approval of the concept. The idea is to identify areas where species would be naturally transferred without using ballast water from ships as a medium, and thus regarded as having the ""same risk"". Ships operating in the ""Same Risk Area"" can then be exempted from IMO's requirement to install ballast water management systems. This makes it easier for ships operating short voyages in our region, while ensuring that we play our part in protecting the marine environment."
180,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Back home, we must continue to invest in quality infrastructure to provide the needed capacity and strengthen Singapore's global connectivity. We are currently building Tuas Terminal and developing Changi East including the new Terminal 5 (T5). Mr Chairman, with your permission, I would like to display some photos on the LED screens."
181,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Reclamation works for Tuas Terminal are progressing well, and we are on track to commence the first phase of operations in 2021. Not only will Tuas Terminal be able to handle high container volumes and bigger vessels, it will be a smarter port – with a higher degree of automation to improve efficiency, safety and service levels. Similarly, the development of Changi East is on track and T5 is expected to commence operations around 2030. "
182,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Before T5 comes on stream, we will enhance our current airport infrastructure. Terminal 1’s upgrading is nearing completion. Jewel will also open on 17 April, with aviation facilities that will improve the travel experience for passengers, such as early check-in facilities, integrated ticketing and baggage services for fly-cruise and fly-coach transfers, in addition to its array of attractions and retail and dining offerings. I am happy to hear from Mr Sitoh that he believes Jewel Changi Airport will be a delight for visitors and Singaporeans alike."
183,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"And I guess he must be referring to popular F&B brands like American Fast Food Chain, Shake Shack, London's famed Burger & Lobster chain, Merdeka's Generation's old favourite A&W and local delight like Violet Onn's restaurant. I had the privilege to go on a sneak preview of Jewel together with Mr Sitoh and my first impression was ""Wow!"". Indeed, it will live up to its name ""Jewel"" and be a world-class lifestyle destination set to inspire and entertain visitors, both local and overseas."
184,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Upgrading works on Terminal 2 will also start soon. Terminal 2 will be expanded and refreshed, with automated check-in kiosks, biometric-enabled bag-drops and automated immigration gates, to offer passengers greater convenience from check-in to immigration to their flight.  "
185,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Harnessing technology and innovation is one of our main strategies under the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) for both air and sea transport. Since the ITMs were rolled out early last year, we have been working closely with the industry and unions, to review systems and processes, and use technology to augment human capabilities.  "
186,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"At the airport, airside drivers drive tractors to tow baggage between terminals and aircraft. This process is strenuous. So, with support from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), SATS, the largest ground handler at Changi, is experimenting with Autonomous Container Trailers. If successful, it would mean less physically straining jobs, and more higher-skilled jobs such as Autonomous Vehicle Operators and Fleet Managers.  "
187,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We are also automating our sea port to raise productivity. Jurong Port previously used traditional forklifts and flatbed trailers to unload steel, which constitutes more than half of their handled cargo. It now deploys customised sideloaders, which has helped to reduce its manpower requirement for steel unloading by 60%.  "
188,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Such technologies make a real difference to our port workers. One of them is Mr Haja Maidin, who worked as a Container Equipment Specialist at PSA for the past 27 years. The automation of yard cranes at Pasir Panjang Terminal gave Mr Haja the opportunity to take on a supervisory role as a Ground Operations Controller. He also picked up new skills to use stowage planning systems.  "
189,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Besides investing in technology, we want to help our companies embrace technology. To support SMEs, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), in collaboration with the Infocomm Media Development Authority and Enterprise Singapore, will roll out the Sea Transport Industry Digital Plan (IDP) under the SMEs Go Digital Programme. The idea is to make going digital simple for SMEs. The IDP provides a step-by-step guide on digital technologies that SMEs can adopt at different stages of growth. SMEs can also tap on available Government co-funding when they adopt the list of digital solutions relevant for the sea transport sector for their digital journey. As a start, we will be rolling out the Sea Transport IDP to ship agency and harbour craft companies. More details will be provided at the Sea Transport IDP launch. "
190,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," We will also continue to experiment and push the boundaries of emerging technology. The payoffs will not be immediate. Mr Pritam Singh asked about the Centre of Excellence for Air Traffic Management. The Centre of Excellence for ATM Programme Fund of $200 million was established in 2012 and as of now $142 million has been committed for research and development projects in air traffic management. For example, the Centre of Excellence's initiated research activities to explore a smart digital tower concept for high intensity operations at Changi Airport. This project has progressed from the laboratory to the field where we have commenced the development of a smart digital tower prototype in January 2018. "
191,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Pritam Singh also asked the status of our space-based VHF communications for air traffic management. Globally, space-based VHF communications technology is still nascent and still under development. CAAS is in the design phase together with our industry partners. But it is important that we help our companies build deep capabilities today, so that they gain competitive advantages for the future.  "
192,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Several companies are already taking a lead in building that ""innovator’s DNA"" in their workforce. SIA and Lufthansa have opened their own innovation labs in Singapore to trial new technologies. Wärtsilä, a Finnish maritime company, has also set up their Digital Acceleration Centre as part of MPA’s Living Lab initiative. "
193,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," We will continue to create a supportive environment and explore deeper collaborations with the industry. One area is unmanned aircraft systems, more commonly referred to as drones. To support innovative uses of drones, MPA and CAAS will launch the Maritime Drone Estate near Marina South Pier. Its close proximity to an anchorage provides a conducive environment to test-bed and develop drone technology for maritime applications. It will also serve as a regulatory sandbox for the development of regulatory and safety standards for maritime drone operations.  "
194,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," The industry has already been active in this arena. For example, Wilhelmsen and Airbus are trialling the use of drones to deliver goods from shore to ship, which will increase productivity and reduce manpower needed compared to deliveries by boats today. "
195,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"As we facilitate more beneficial uses of drones, we are mindful of the potential safety and security threats arising from its errant and irresponsible use, as seen from the incidents at Gatwick and Newark airports. In January, I had informed the House that we have in place measures to deal with such threats, and coordinate very closely with the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Home Affairs on such efforts. To ensure that drones are operated safely, CAAS is also looking into strengthening the Unmanned Aircraft Regulatory Framework. This may include the mandatory registration of drones.  "
196,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Mr Chairman, our aviation and maritime investments will create rewarding career opportunities for Singaporeans. For example, Jewel Changi Airport will open up over 2,000 new retail and hospitality jobs. Businesses are participating in Workforce Singapore’s career fairs to recruit locals into these jobs.  "
197,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Our efforts to attract global players to grow their businesses in Singapore will also create more job and business opportunities. Last year, we welcomed new entrants into our maritime sector, such as Thenemaris and Cheng Lie Navigation. Key players already in Singapore such as Ocean Network Express (ONE), Wilhelmsen Ship Management and Wärtsilä have also expanded their operations here.  "
198,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," At the same time, under the ITMs, the Government, unions and companies are working together to develop a future-ready aviation and maritime workforce. Some workers may worry about how their current jobs will be affected by technological changes, and whether their skillsets will remain relevant for the future. I want to assure them that we will support them to grow and learn new skills.  "
199,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," CAAS and SkillsFuture Singapore, in consultation with tripartite partners, launched the Skills Framework for the Air Transport Sector last year. It informs employees of career pathways and the skills required for different jobs, and provides companies with guidelines for better employee training. More aviation companies are using the framework to invest in the training and development of their employees. For example, SATS has set up a SATS Academy which introduces interesting ways of staff training, such as using virtual reality to simulate scenarios for technical ramp training. We are also better integrating studies and work. We already have several programmes that allow students and employees to work and study at the same time. "
200,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"One such programme is MPA’s Global Internship Award (GIA) which allows students to intern at international maritime companies, whilst still pursuing their undergraduate studies. Mr Damon Er interned at Braemar ACM Shipbroking under the GIA in 2016, when he was still studying at NTU. He received a job offer right after the internship, and is now working as a dry cargo Capesize trainee broker. "
201,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Aspiring port engineers can enroll in the Work-Learn Technical Diploma in Port Automation Technology, run by PSA and ITE. It helps our students and workers acquire skillsets necessary for a highly automated port, through a combination of structured classroom teaching and on-the-job training at PSA.  "
202,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," We have received good feedback on the Earn-and-Learn Programme (ELP) which allows fresh graduates to work and obtain an industry-recognised certification at the same time. Mr Elias Heng started his career under the ELP for Marine Engineering Officer and sailed as a Fourth Engineer with Apex Ship Management Pte Ltd. The structured on-the-job training helped him prepare for higher seafaring certifications. Upon completion of the ELP, he went on to further his training and has since been promoted to a Third Engineer with Apex.  "
203,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Likewise, Ms Kylie Pang, a SATS customer services agent, pursued two skills-based Modular Certificates under the ELP which helped her develop both soft and technical skills. This gave her a head-start in her career. She is now working towards completing the three remaining Modular Certificates, to obtain a Diploma in Aviation Management from Temasek Polytechnic.  "
204,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," This year, MPA will introduce another ELP for shore-based jobs in the ship owning, ship operating and ship broking sectors. And CAAS will enhance the course fee support to cover three additional modular certifications for the Passenger Service Agents ELP. With these enhancements, more people will benefit from the ELP, just like Elias and Kylie. "
205,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Mr Chairman, as we reflect on our past and chart our plans for the future, we know that a Singapore that is well-connected to the world is key to our success."
206,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.
207,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Acting Minister for Transport (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Acting Minister for Transport (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan): Mr Chairman, Minister Khaw has asked me to convey his apologies for missing COS. I can assure all of you that he is recovering well after surgery and, in fact, has been following the debate assiduously. He also asked me to reassure you that he will actively pursue all your suggestions and advice when he returns. He has also asked me to remind everyone that every year in Singapore, one-third of seniors sustain injuries from falls. Many of these incidents occur at home, usually at night or early morning. In fact, as a doctor, I can tell you the most vulnerable moments are those few seconds or minutes when you wake up from and get out of bed. "
208,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Let me now turn to domestic transport. We all want a public transport system that is safe, reliable, convenient and affordable. Four worthy objectives, but sometimes you have to make some tough choices and trade-offs. Bear these words in mind: safe, reliable, convenient, affordable. Our transport system is actually in a very strong position, that is thanks to many generations of visionary leaders, meticulous planners and, of course, the transport workers themselves who work long hours. They wake up way before everyone else has woken up and they also work into the wee hours of the night to maintain and operate our bus and rail network. All of them deserve our tribute."
209,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin has emphasised that the Government's spending on transport has more than doubled over the last 10 years, from $5.4 billion in 2009 to now $11.5 billion in 2019. A doubling in 10 years. We are expanding our MRT network which after all, is the backbone of our public transport system. Over the last five years, we completed the Downtown Line and Tuas West Extension, and we added close to 50 km to our network. We will open the first phase of our sixth MRT line – the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) by the end of this year. TEL will add another 32 stations and 43 km more to our MRT network, and eventually serve up to one million commuters. By around 2030, we can look forward to the opening of the Circle Line Stage 6, the Jurong Region Line and the Cross Island Line. When all these new lines come onstream, we will achieve our target of having eight in 10 households within a 10-minute walk from a train station."
210,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We added 200 trains over the last five years. We also introduced 1,000 buses under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme, and this was completed in 2017. We are conducting trials with on-demand buses and cleaner, greener vehicles. We have also added 500 km of road lanes over the last 10 years, and are building more. "
211,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin has noted the improved rail reliability. We achieved Mean Kilometres Between Failures (MKBF) of 690,000 train-km in 2018, which is more than triple the 181,000 train-km in 2017."
212,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"But this is, as Minister Khaw has emphasised in the past, a multi-year effort. He has also said that we are not out of the woods yet. We will continue to work on improving rail reliability. In fact, we have to continue to work on this. We are also renewing and enhancing the Bukit Panjang LRT (BPLRT), which now requires new trains, resignalling and power rail system enhancements. With these efforts, we hope the BPLRT will also become a lot more reliable in the future, and I must confess that I have a personal stake in this as one of the local Members of Parliament."
213,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Our commuters have noticed the improvements. The independent Public Transport Council (PTC) tracks this through the annual Public Transport Customer Satisfaction Survey. I think Assoc Prof Walter Theseira referred to this in his speech. The mean satisfaction score went up to 7.9 in 2018, which is the highest level since we started measuring in 2008."
214,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"LTA embarked on its most extensive public engagement exercise thus far for the Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP 2040). We are grateful to the more than 7,000 Singaporeans who have contributed ideas to this plan. The LTMP Advisory Panel, which is chaired by Senior Minister of State Janil, has worked very hard to take all these views into account and submitted its recommendations to the Government on 15 February 2019."
215,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The Panel appreciated that a transport system does not just convey people to a place. It brings people together and, if you think about it, it forms a significant part of our daily shared lived experience. A bad commuting experience can disrupt your mood and and day, almost as much as a domestic dispute at home. So, this is why people feel so strongly about the quality, reliability and experience of travelling. The Panel has, therefore, recommended enhancing the travel experience through greater connectivity and better service for everyone. The Panel also understood that there is, ultimately, a limit to infrastructure building on our tiny island."
216,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,The Panel has proposed a bold new vision – a healthy and safe 20-minute town travel and a 45-Minute City travel for everyone by 2040. The Government accepts the Panel’s recommendations. Senior Minister of State Janil will elaborate on the LTMP 2040 later. 
217,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Let me now deal with the politically-sensitive topic of fiscal sustainability. Many Members have brought this up. I agree with Mr Sitoh Yih Pin and Assoc Prof Walter Theseira that we need to exercise fiscal discipline in order to reduce costs and maximise value for money. How is this being done? Let me cite four ways in which LTA is trying to achieve this.
218,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"First, always look out for novel design solutions. For example, LTA engineers saved about $2 billion in construction costs with the East Coast Integrated Depot. This depot is going to be a 4-in-1, with three MRT depots for the East-West Line, Downtown Line and the upcoming TEL, which are stacked one on top of another, and there is also a bus depot for 760 buses. This is the first such facility of its kind. LTA’s engineers have also saved more than $3 billion in potential construction costs by shifting the depot and the reception tracks for the Cross Island Line above ground."
219,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The second way – always look at life cycle costs when procuring major assets that will operate for decades. When the first generation North-South and East-West Line trains were due for renewal, LTA challenged the train manufacturers to design systems using the latest technology that would be easier and cheaper to maintain throughout the 30-year life cycle of the trains."
220,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Third, leverage competitive market forces wherever appropriate and whenever possible. For instance, the Bus Contracting Model ensures contestability through open tenders for bus packages. This has brought down the average bus contract bid prices by about 20% since the first bus package was awarded four years ago."
221,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Fourth, incentivise – and you will notice I use the word ""incentivise"" – commuters to change their behavior where possible and where convenient in order to optimise the overall performance of the system. This is something which I think Assoc Prof Walter Theseira has been pursuing for quite some time. I have noticed his speeches in this Chamber and he has asked about differential fares. These were introduced by PTC in December 2017. If you strip away the jargo, this is actually is about saving money and improving the travel experience by encouraging more rail commuters to travel during off-peak hours. The number of commuters traveling during the morning pre-peak period has now increased by about 12%. We will continue to look for ways to smoothen out these peaks and troughs which, Assoc Prof Theseira, as an economist, will tell you have a very important impact on overall long-term system costs but, at the same time, improves the travelling experience for people, as it is less crowded. It does so in a positive way through differential fares. "
222,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"But even as we do this, we need to be mindful that not all commuters have the flexibility to change their commuting patterns. Even with such measures in place, the brutal hard truth is that a high-quality public transport system still requires significant resources. The perennial question – and it is a political question as well – remains ""How do we strike the right balance between the costs borne by taxpayers, commuters and operators?"""
223,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I emphasised taxpayers because every dollar that the Government puts into the public transport system ultimately comes from taxpayers. So, remember there is always a balancing act that is necessary."
224,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Now, on the Government's side – and that means, on the taxpayers' side of the equation – we will continue to keep fares affordable by fully funding all infrastructure costs and providing significant operating subsidies. Over the next five years, the Government expects to provide $5 billion in subsidies for public bus services and around $4.5 billion to renew our rail operating assets. The Government will also spend another $26 billion to expand the bus and rail networks, also over the next five years. This is why, despite the improvements in capacity and reliability, public transport actually has become more affordable. In fact, over the last decade, monthly expenditure on public transport, as a proportion of household income for the lower income group, has come down from 4.1% to 2.7%."
225,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"But I also want to say this. It is inevitable that fares will have to keep pace with costs. In 2018, the PTC introduced a Network Capacity Factor into the fare formula. I think Mr Dennis Tan also referred to this in his intervention earlier. Basically, this factor allows the fares to be adjusted in tandem with capacity changes of our public transport network relative to commuter demand. What I am trying to say in simple terms is this, we would all like to increase capacity to make it more convenient and improve the travel experience. But all of you here also know that an increase in capacity comes with an increase in cost. I would like, however, to assure Mr Dennis Tan that we will certainly caibrate the expansion of rail capacity so that it expands in tandem with ridership growth. It is not feasible anyway to have unlimited expansion in capacity, and I am sure that the impact of NCF will be managed in due course."
226,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Dennis Tan also suggested factoring in service quality. This is another example where I agree with his intention. I think the divergence is in the method. Service standards, including on-time performance reliability, are already regulated through existing frameworks. But these frameworks are outside the fare formula. What do I mean by that? In other words, these standards are imposed by LTA on the operators as conditions for service. In addition, operators can be penalised for breach of regulatory standards or breach of licence conditions and the penalties paid are calibrated to ensure fairness and accountability. The penalties paid accrue to the Public Transport Fund which, as you all know, is then redistributed, especially to the lower income families. This is used, therefore, to provide financial assistance on the one hand, but also to serve as a disincentive against the operators taking shortcuts."
227,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Dennis Tan also suggested factoring operators' profitability into the fare formula. The profitability of public transport operators, in fact, is already taken into consideration in the fare review mechanism. For example, the productivity gains of public transport operators are shared with commuters through the Productivity Extraction Factor in the fare formula. A lot of words. If you look up the briefing, it is in there in the formula. I think PTC will happily have this conversation with you offline."
228,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The point is this. The operators also contribute a portion of the fare increase into the Public Transport Fund. Typically, they contribute about 20%-50% of the expected increase in fare revenue for that year, with the more profitable public transport operators contributing more, I think this is fair."
229,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"This puts in place a formal mechanism for the public transport operators to share their gains with commuters. Let me assure you that that the PTC will continue to keep a close watch on fare affordability for all commuters, especially for specific groups like senior citizens, low-income individuals and persons with disabilities. The PTC has done well and I am confident it will continue to strike the right balance. The key word here is ""balance"" – balance between fare affordability and the long-term fiscal sustainability of our public transport system."
230,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,I spoke last week in my capacity as the Minister for Foreign Affairs on managing relations with Malaysia. Let me now specifically address Members' queries on transport-related issues with Malaysia.
231,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"As Members know, several transport-related issues have arose – the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR) project. Then, there was the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link (RTS Link) project, as well as the airspace and maritime boundary issues."
232,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Our approach to engaging Malaysia remains unchanged. We have upheld international law and we respected the sanctity of international agreements. At the same time, we have been reasonable, we have been constructive in trying to resolve issues in a win-win manner."
233,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"First, the HSR project. In fact, this is a case in point. In August last year, Malaysia requested to defer the HSR project. In the spirit of bilateral cooperation, we agreed to Malaysia's request, and both sides agreed to a two-year suspension up to 31 May 2020. As part of the agreement, Malaysia agreed, and I can confirm, has remitted to Singapore about S$15 million on 31 January 2019 and and this is for the abortive costs that were incurred by Singapore due to the two-year suspension."
234,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Malaysia has requested that during the suspension period, both sides discuss the way forward for the HSR Project, with the aim of reducing the overall costs. We have yet to receive any new proposals from Malaysia on this but we will certainly study any such proposals carefully when we receive them. We look forward to working with Malaysia when the project resumes."
235,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"On the RTS Link, this is another rail project that we have with Malaysia. And it was Mr Ang Wei Neng who quite rightly pointed out that the RTS Link should significantly ease congestion at our land checkpoints which, by the way, are the busiest land checkpoints in the world. This will make it much more convenient for people to travel between Singapore and Johor Bahru."
236,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Minister Khaw updated the House in January that the RTS Link project has seen some delays. Unfortunately, the project is likely to face further delays. We are now at the stage where both Governments are obliged to jointly call an open tender to appoint the RTS Link Operating Company (OpCo). Singapore fully expects both countries to fully abide by this obligation and has made this clear to Malaysia. Whilst emphasising the obligation of both Governments to call a fair, open and transparent international tender to appoint the OpCo, but in the spirit of bilateral cooperation, Singapore has been willing to engage Malaysia on its proposals for Malaysia's Joint Venture (JV) partner for the RTS Link OpCo."
237,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Unfortunately, Malaysia has repeatedly delayed confirming its JV partner for the RTS Link OpCo. Most recently, on 28 February 2019, Malaysia asked for another deadline extension to 31 March 2019. We hope that they will reach a decision soon. Given these delays, the RTS Link service, quite frankly, is no longer on track to commence by the original date of 31 December 2024."
238,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Singapore continues to believe that the RTS Link is a mutually beneficial project, and I would like to assure Mr Ang Wei Neng that we remain fully committed to implementing the project as per the RTS Link Bilateral Agreement."
239,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,We have also been engaging Malaysia in order to find constructive solutions to both maritime and airspace issues.
240,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"On 25 October 2018, Malaysia decided to unilaterally extend the Johor Bahru Port Limits into Singapore's territorial waters off Tuas. This purported extension goes beyond even Malaysia's own territorial sea claims according to its own 1979 map, which Singapore has consistently rejected. The inescapable conclusion is that the new Johor Bahru Port Limits transgress into what are indisputably Singapore Territorial Waters."
241,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Since then, both sides have been engaged in intensive discussions to de-escalate the situation. We have made reasonable progress so far, and I hope to make some joint announcements with my counterpart Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah within the next one or two weeks. So, akan datang."
242,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked if the ongoing maritime dispute will affect the viability of our future Tuas Terminal. The answer is ""no"". Development works are proceeding as planned, and there will be no impact to access for ships calling at the terminal in the future. I can assure Mr Ang that our security agencies will continue to be vigilant, and safeguard the sovereignty and security of our territorial waters."
243,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Now, let me move on to airspace issues. "
244,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,I think it was Mr Pritam Singh who asked about Singapore's air navigation arrangements with our neighbours. Let me start by emphasising that it is the safety and efficiency of civil aviation for tens of millions of passengers that are the paramount considerations underlying all airspace and air navigation arrangements. Those are the key words – safety and efficiency.
245,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Air navigation arrangements, as Mr Singh knows, are complex, technical and operational matters which are under the jurisdiction of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). ICAO prioritises the safety and efficiency of civil aviation in all its policies, standards and recommended practices."
246,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Singapore's provision of air traffic services (ATS) for the region actually started way back in 1946, when ICAO allocated to Singapore the responsibility, the task for the provision of ATS in the Singapore Flight Information Region (FIR). In 1973, ICAO approved the creation of the Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu FIRs which, in fact, were carved out from the then Singapore FIR and allocated to Malaysia. At the same time, ICAO also approved the arrangements under which Singapore would provide ATS over portions of southern Peninsular Malaysia, within the KL FIR. The 1973 ICAO decision was a regional consensus, and struck a balance between the needs of both Singapore and Malaysia, and the international aviation community. Singapore and Malaysia concluded an agreement in 1974 to implement this ICAO decision."
247,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Through these decades, Singapore has been providing ATS to the highest standards of safety and efficiency, in accordance with our responsibilities under international law, and ICAO's stipulated standards and practices. In 2018, Singapore managed 740,000 flights in the Singapore FIR. Half of these 740,000 flights landed or departed from Changi Airport. The other half consisted of overflights, many of which were, in fact, to and from other airports in the region. The region's aviation sector has benefited greatly from all these arrangements. This has been a win-win arrangement for the region, for our neighbours and for us."
248,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Members are aware that our closest neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, have expressed their desire to see some changes to these existing airspace arrangements in our region. We are certainly willing to address their concerns and let me also emphasise this. Singapore fully respects Malaysia's and Indonesia's sovereignty over their airspace. These are not boundary disputes."
249,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"At the same time, discussions on air navigation arrangements must fundamentally be based on technical and operational considerations, for the purpose of ensuring the safety and efficiency of civil aviation. And any changes to these arrangements, if warranted, must be done properly, in accordance with the rules, the requirements and the decisions set out by ICAO. Any such changes must further enhance safety and efficiency, and must benefit all airspace users. And do not forget, stakeholders, such as airlines, who use this space, must also be consulted."
250,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I agree with Mr Singh on the need to invest in technology so that Singapore remains the safest, the most reliable provider of air traffic services. Singapore has always recognised the edge that technology can bring, particularly in a highly technical field, such as ATS provision. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has consistently invested in its air traffic management (ATM) capabilities over many decades, focusing on three critical aspects: machine, man and method."
251,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Let us start with machine. Singapore's ATM systems are one of the most advanced in the world, and highly customised, incorporating cutting-edge technologies such as space-based Automatic Dependant Surveillance (Broadcast) (ADS-B). They love acronyms in this field. Space-based ADS-B systems overcome the limitations of ground-based systems, which cannot be deployed over the vast expanse of sea to track aircraft."
252,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Man. CAAS' air traffic controllers have been trained to a very high standard and are internationally recognised to be highly proficient, and they contribute extensively to setting global standards in ICAO and to industry organisations."
253,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Third, method. CAAS' ATM processes and operating procedures are highly advanced and innovative whilst still maintaining fidelity to the highest safety standards. CAAS is a first-mover in developing and using advanced concepts in ATM."
254,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Let me give you an example. CAAS has pioneered the Distributed Multi-Nodal Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) network concept. ATFM basically helps to better manage traffic demand and capacity, particularly during times when there is an imbalance, and they do so by regulating flight arrival and departure times taking into account live operational conditions. This project has succeeded in achieving fuel savings for airlines, reducing the period of time that aircraft spend in airborne holding patterns. Now, even more Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) and airports around the region are keen to increase their involvement in the project. Our neighbours Malaysia and Indonesia are also participants in the project. CAAS has set up a new ATFM operations centre in the Singapore Air Traffic Control Centre to fully implement this concept in order to enhance Singapore’s air traffic service provision and contribution to the region.  "
255,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Singapore takes the ATM responsibilities that we have been entrusted with by ICAO very seriously. We will continue to invest in enhancing these capabilities and to discharge our responsibilities to the highest standards to achieve safety and efficiency and it will benefit the region and, indeed, the entire international aviation community."
256,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Ang Wei Neng has asked about our bilateral discussions regarding Seletar Airport. Following Minister Khaw’s meeting with Malaysian Minister of Transport Mr Anthony Loke on 23 January, both sides agreed to extend the mutual suspension of the instrument landing system (ILS) for Seletar Airport, and the Restricted Area over Pasir Gudang until 31 March 2019. "
257,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We have explained to Malaysia that Seletar Airport has been serving charter, medevac and MRO flights without issues for decades and should continue to operate normally. I have also personally spoken to Minister Loke on 27 February and we are both closely monitoring the progress of these sensitive discussions between our senior officials. "
258,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Chairman, I would now invite Senior Minister of State Janil to elaborate on the detailed plans for our land transport system.  "
259,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary): Mr Chairman, our land transport network connects millions of Singaporeans every day to homes, jobs and schools. It is a shared space, an economic enabler and a social leveller. As Minister Vivian has noted, it is a maturing network, thanks to the efforts of leaders, planners and transport workers who have made this happen before us.  "
260,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," However, this maturing system brings with it a different set of challenges. Through our work on the Land Transport Master Plan 2040 (LTMP 2040), it is clear that trade-offs between competing priorities are becoming more difficult to balance as we run up against tighter land, manpower and fiscal constraints. For example, we have heard that Singaporeans value convenience and faster journeys. However, how do we provide this without compromising on safety and accessibility, especially for those with more diverse needs, such as the disabled? Given our space constraints, how do we prioritise one mode of transport over another, knowing that this could result in slower speeds for some?  "
261,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," These are the realities we have to address for the next phase of development of our land transport system, and there are no easy answers. We must hold a long-term, clear-eyed view in managing these issues, and continue to enhance our land transport network to meet Singapore's and Singaporeans' growing needs, changing demographics and evolving aspirations. We embarked on an extensive public consultation process to reach out to Singaporeans from all walks of life. Fourteen members from the public, private and people sectors joined the LTMP Advisory Panel to study the feedback received and to recommend the visions, targets and strategies for LTMP 2040. "
262,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Through this public consultation process, the Panel considered 7,405 responses over six months from commuters, transport workers, academia, industry partners, unions, students and interest groups. Their ideas shaped the strategies and targets identified to improve our land transport system. We learned what Singaporeans value and want from our land transport system, and we have set ourselves bold targets for 2040. "
263,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),, The Panel made three key recommendations: 
264,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," First, 20-Minute Towns and a 45-Minute City. By 2040, Singaporeans can look forward to “20-Minute Towns” where almost all journeys to the nearest neighbourhood centre on public, active and shared transport modes can be completed within 20 minutes. Singaporeans will also be able to enjoy a “45-Minute City” where nine in 10 peak hour journeys on public, active and shared transport can be completed within 45 minutes. "
265,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Public, active and shared transport is the only sustainable way forward with our land constraints. Let me explain. ""Public"" refers to, of course, our public transport system, our buses and trains. ""Active"" referring to Active Mobility – walking, cycling and personal mobility devices. ""Shared"" can refer to the other two as well. Public transport is also shared. Many active mobility services can also be shared but, specifically, we also want to include shared transport through taxis, private hire cars and shared vehicles.  "
266,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Some have asked whether this means that they will not benefit if their journeys today already take less than 20 or 45 minutes. These efforts to achieve 20-Minute Towns and a 45-Minute City will benefit all Singaporeans. It will have an impact on traffic flow, an impact on congestion an impact on how we move around our city easily, regardless of how long journey times are today. These improvements in public, active and shared transport would save the average weekday commuter 15 minutes every day by 2040.  "
267,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," LTA is now studying the specific initiatives to achieve these targets and will announce them in a few months’ time. Even as they do so, it remains clear that a convenient, resilient and efficient public transport network will be central to us achieving this “20-Minute Towns and a 45-Minute City” vision. "
268,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," To achieve 20-Minute Towns, we will have to continue to improve connectivity within the towns. Apart from enhancing infrastructure to facilitate active mobility options for shorter, intra-town commutes, we are also conducting trials of on-demand public buses (ODPBs). Mr Melvin Yong asked for an update on the on-going ODPB trial. While the technology is still evolving, the initial results are encouraging. Operated mileage has been reduced in some areas by more than 25% – one quarter – while allowing most ODPB commuters to enjoy journey times comparable to regular bus services. So, 25% reduction in operated mileage, same journey times. Ridership has also been increasing. We will continue to explore ways to improve the service by adapting these trial parameters and refining the ODPB algorithm. We will also monitor commuter feedback to assess how and if the trial can be expanded to include peak hours and weekends. This will help us to identify the key success factors for the ODPB concept, including adjustments to the way we roster our bus captains to ensure that they have sufficient rest. In time to come, we can also explore virtual bus stops. But this will require us to strike a careful balance between safety and convenience. We also will study the extent to which ODPBs can improve first- and last-mile connectivity to allow even more Singaporeans to benefit, regardless of their proximity to an MRT station. Such dynamically routed bus services have the potential to reduce travelling and waiting times for intra-town journeys and allow commuters to enjoy more seamless commutes.  "
269,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," To achieve a 45-Minute City, I agree with Mr Ang Wei Neng that rail must continue to be the backbone of our public transport network. Even as we pursue our ambitions, I am happy to report that we are on track to achieve the targets set in our last LTMP. The announcement of the Jurong Region Line in 2018 and the first phase of the Cross Island Line (CRL) earlier this year puts us yet another step closer to having eight in 10 households within a 10-minute walk from a train station. This was the previous LTMP target to achieve in 2030, 10 years before the outcomes that we are hoping for in LTMP 2040. We will continue to review and expand our rail network where there is sufficient ridership."
270,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mayor Low Yen Ling and her residents would be delighted, I hope, to know that we have plans to fully fit out and open Hume station on Downtown Line 2 (DTL2). [Applause] By 2025. [Laughter]. Hume station was originally designed as a shell station on DTL2 as the pace of developments and ridership growth in the area did not warrant it opening with the other DTL2 stations. Mayor Low Yen Ling has worked hard on behalf of her residents and she has worked with our public sector agencies. She has highlighted and advocated for the potential of the area and the needs of her residents. We have worked closely with her and her community leaders to see how we can improve the commuting experience for residents in the new estates."
271,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Since then, these new development plans have been made, partly because of the advocacy and the engagement by Mayor Low and her community leaders – the redevelopment of the Rail Corridor and the transformation of the nearby Bukit Timah Fire Station into a Gateway Node for the surrounding nature and heritage attractions and other developments. With all these, there will be sufficient ridership to justify opening Hume station. Likewise, further addition of new bus services in Bukit Gombak will depend on the pace of development and ridership growth in the area. We are also studying other rail projects beyond 2030 that will bring us closer to the “45-Minute City”. These will be announced when the LTMP is launched in a few months."
272,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"As Sitoh Yih Pin has pointed out, it is important that we continue to exercise financial prudence as we develop our land transport network. In deciding which areas to extend our rail network to, we will have to balance between managing costs and benefiting the most number of Singaporeans possible, taking into account the characteristics of each area."
273,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"As an example, I would like to address the suggestion by Mr Arasu Duraisamy that we study the feasibility of a new MRT line to Tuas South and Jurong Island."
274,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"For Tuas South, the area is still in the initial stages of development and there is not enough ridership in the near to medium term to support an MRT line. Nevertheless, we have taken steps to improve bus connectivity to the Tuas South area. With the opening of the Tuas West Extension in June 2017, LTA launched two new public bus services in the Tuas South area – services 247 and 248. When the Jurong Region Line (JRL) and Cross Island Line are completed, workers in Tuas South will benefit.  "
275,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," As for Jurong Island, there are no plans to extend the MRT onto the island itself. However, workers will benefit from the future Jurong Pier Station, which is located only a short distance away from Jurong Island Checkpoint. Once the JRL is completed in 2028, they can travel on the JRL to the Checkpoint before transferring to a shuttle bus or company transport taking them through security and onwards to the various industries on the island. And, for example, if we were to put a station on Jurong Island itself, it is unlikely to create any added convenience or time savings because the workers would still have to go through the Checkpoint security and transfer to an onward last-mile shuttle to their final destination, given how spread out the developments are on the island. So, we will have to balance the effectiveness of such a solution and the costs.  "
276,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Mr Chairman, we cannot achieve our vision of 20-Minute Towns and a 45-Minute City through infrastructure developments alone. Our public transport system is built to support peak tidal travel demand during the short two-hour window on weekday mornings and evenings, as many Singaporeans living all over the island commute to jobs in the city centre. We need to optimise the distribution of jobs and housing across the island. This will reduce travel times as more people live closer to their workplace. This is, in fact, another way of redistributing peak travel demand and make better use of transport infrastructure, as noted by Prof Walter Theseira. "
277,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Today, there are already regional centres in Tampines, Woodlands and Jurong East that are well connected to nearby amenities and jobs. We, in MOT and LTA, are collaborating with other agencies on upcoming key developments, including the Jurong Lake District, Jurong Innovation District, Woodlands North Coast and the Punggol Digital District. These will be well connected by Transit Priority Corridors – we do not have any of these yet but we are going to build some. These will have features, such as dedicated turns and lanes for public and private buses, as well as other types of connectivity, apart from the Transit Priority Corridors to link these developments, such as the new rail projects which we have already announced – the Thomson East-Coast Line and North-East Line extension. Taken altogether, the redistribution, these Transit Priority Corridors, the work that we are already doing on the MRT lines will shorten our daily commutes to work and play, and take us closer to our vision of 20-Minute Towns and a 45-Minute City. "
278,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," The second key recommendation by the Advisory Panel is to build a more Inclusive Transport System. Through the LTMP public consultation process, Singaporeans have expressed the desire for a land transport system which is inclusive and welcoming to all Singaporeans. This means a culture where commuters look out for one another, especially those who are more in need. Singaporeans acknowledged that achieving this gracious commuting culture is a shared responsibility between Government, transport operators, transport workers and commuters. I am heartened that Singaporeans are willing to play their part, and my colleague Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng will later elaborate on strategies to make our land transport system a more inclusive and friendly space for all Singaporeans.  "
279,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,These planned infrastructural enhancements and the inclusion strategies will complement efforts towards the Panel’s third key recommendation on Healthy Lives and Safer Journeys.
280,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"A comprehensive suite of public, active and shared transport options will reduce our reliance on privately-owned vehicles and contribute towards a healthier environment. This will complement ongoing initiatives by different Ministries to improve the health of Singapore and Singaporeans, including through the reduction of vehicle emissions. For example, we work with MEWR on the Vehicular Emissions Scheme and the Early Turnover Scheme to encourage owners to use cleaner vehicles. The electric car-sharing programme, jointly supported by LTA and the Economic Development Board (EDB), is another example. Under this, BlueSG will roll out a total of 500 charging stations equipped with 2,000 charging points nationwide. To date, BlueSG has installed 687 charging points."
281,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The Government will also take the lead in building a cleaner transport system. By 2040, we will upgrade all our public buses to cleaner energy sources. I am pleased to announce that key industry players in the point-to-point sector are also following the Government’s lead. All the taxi companies and some of the private hire car booking providers and car rental companies have committed to making their entire fleet run on cleaner energy by 2040. This is the first time that we have an industry-led target for the Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP)."
282,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Apart from a healthier environment, we will continue to encourage active mobility as a way to meet Singaporeans’ aspirations for a healthier life. Supporting this will require us to change the way we plan towns, to make active modes of transport more convenient. Senior Minister of State Lam Pin Min will elaborate further on some of the initiatives planned to encourage more commuters to incorporate healthier modes of transport into their daily routines."
283,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"While we plan to improve speeds and convenience, I agree with Ms Cheng Li Hui that safety cannot be compromised. Our bus safety record has improved over the past year. Our public buses had an accident rate of 0.11 accidents per 100,000 bus service kilometres in 2018, a third lower than the 0.15 in 2017. But every life lost on our roads or paths is one too many."
284,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We must work towards reducing land transport fatalities. To do this, we will introduce more pedestrian-friendly features, such as Silver Zones, to reduce vehicular speeds."
285,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Secondly, we will introduce signalised right turns at all traffic junctions where it is feasible."
286,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Third, we are exploring enhanced safety management systems, such as anti-fatigue, collision warning and blindspot warning systems, to aid our bus captains. These will provide audio cues or vibrations to keep the driver alert, and they are already a standard requirement for our public buses."
287,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Chairman, many of our LTMP 2040 strategies rely on technology. Technological innovations in recent years have increased mobility options for commuters. There are also better journey-planning applications, including LTA’s MyTransport.SG mobile app, to help commuters plan multi-modal journeys. This, in turn, has improved the accessibility and utilisation of public transport."
288,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We have also used technology to make our commutes easier, such as through Account-based Ticketing (ABT). Since March 2017, LTA has partnered MasterCard to test the use of contactless bankcards on public transport under the ABT initiative. The pilot was successful and LTA is now working with MasterCard and Visa on the full launch of ABT under the branding of ""SimplyGo"". Starting April 2019, all MasterCard users with compatible contactless cards or mobile phones can use these on our buses and trains. We plan for Visa to be used on public transport later this year. With ""SimplyGo"", commuters will have the option of carrying one less card for transport, or maybe no cards if they use their mobile phones, and not having to do card top-ups."
289,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is another area which can allow us to reinvent how land transport is provided, such as dynamically routed services. AVs will also help us to create new job opportunities in the transport sector. ST Engineering Land Systems is conducting a trial of autonomous buses and partnering with SBS Transit to deploy a few of its bus captains as safety operators. While the widespread deployment of AVs is still years away, such trials give us an early sense of the requirements for the new job roles that will be created."
290,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I agree with Assoc Prof Walter Theseira that our regulatory frameworks must also be flexible enough to guide the flow of technology without constricting it. We must strike a balance between protecting the public interest, achieving our broader transport policy objectives, allowing innovations to thrive, meeting the needs of commuters and creating jobs for transport workers. We need to be clear about what, why and how we want to regulate. How we have evolved our planned regulatory framework for the point-to-point (P2P) sector is a good example."
291,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The rapid growth of ride-hailing applications has disrupted the P2P sector in many cities, leading to strikes, driver unhappiness and commuter inconvenience around the world. Here in Singapore, we have been relatively fortunate. Commuter satisfaction with P2P services continues to remain high. More than 99% of commuters surveyed by the Public Transport Council (PTC) were satisfied with taxi and Private Hire Car (PHC) services in 2018. Such a positive outcome is only possible with responsible operators, sensible commuters, safe drivers and sound policy. In particular, the National Taxi Association (NTA) and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA) have played important roles in helping our drivers adjust to technological transformation in the P2P space."
292,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"PHCs are now an important part of our land transport system, accounting for about 45% of all P2P journeys. In 2018, there were more than 120 million trips completed on PHCs alone. We are in the process of reviewing our regulatory approach for the P2P sector, to ensure that commuters can continue to benefit from a robust and safe P2P space. Mr Ang Hin Kee and Mr Ang Wei Neng spoke about the on-going P2P review. Let me take this opportunity to give Members the broad principles of the revised regulatory framework."
293,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,We intend to introduce a new licensing process for all P2P operators focusing on three key areas.
294,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"First, we will prohibit operators from tying down drivers through exclusivity arrangements, except for those operators that employ drivers. The majority of P2P drivers will then be free to choose which operators to drive for, thus ensuring that the P2P industry continues to be a viable and sustainable sector to make a living in."
295,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Second, we will focus on commuter safety, where all P2P operators will have to play their part to keep commuters and drivers safe."
296,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Third, we will minimise business and regulatory costs for operators and drivers. Part of this involves streamlining, where appropriate, the regulatory differences between streethail and ride-hail services, such as the taxi availability services that Mr Ang Wei Neng has raised. More details will be made available later this year."
297,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"These principles will lay the ground for a safe, open and contestable P2P sector. New players and different business models will be able to enter and start providing P2P solutions for our commuters."
298,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Ang Hin Kee had made suggestions about market size and P2P fares, we will study their feedback. But our intention is not to regulate every single aspect of the P2P market, but to allow market forces to shape some of these more efficiently, and to let competition drive innovation. Ultimately, commuters and drivers will be able to benefit from better services. This will help us to achieve our 20-Minute Towns and 45-Minute City vision."
299,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"As Mr Ang Hin Kee and Mr Ang Wei Neng are aware, our review has been happening in consultation with the industry, as well as the Labour Movement, represented by NTA and NPHVA. As we enter the final stages of our review, we will continue to work closely with our tripartite stakeholders to manage disruptions, to consider the feedback received, to keep in mind the need to protect commuter interests and also taking into account suggestions, such as Mr Ang Hin Kee's, to protect driver interests. We will do so while streamlining regulations and managing business costs."
300,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Ang Hin Kee will be pleased to hear that LTA will be establishing a Private Hire Car Tripartite Committee, to complement the existing Taxi Tripartite Committee. Together, these will provide platforms for LTA, drivers and operators to discuss strategic issues concerning the P2P sector."
301,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,We recently completed our public consultation exercise on 21 February. Members of the public have expressed strong support for the policies that we intend to roll out as part of the new regulatory framework. We agree with and will respond to the call for a more inclusive P2P sector and will work closely with the industry on this. More details will be provided in the coming months.
302,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Chairman, our land transport sector will continue to create opportunities for Singaporean workers and businesses."
303,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Melvin Yong asked about efforts to support public transport workers and meeting future challenges in the land transport sector, including the development and deployment of AVs in future. We will continue to work with unions and industry partners to help workers respond to these emerging technologies."
304,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"In February 2018, we launched the Land Transport Industry Transformation Map (ITM). Under this ITM, the Government is working closely with the unions and operators to upskill our workers, to equip them with the capabilities to do their jobs efficiently and effectively. This is being done through our Institutes of Higher Learning, as well as through the Singapore Bus Academy and Singapore Rail Academy."
305,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We have also established the ITM Tripartite Steering Committee co-chaired by National Transport Workers’ Union (NTWU) and LTA to identify interventions to help workers respond to these emerging technologies. I would like to congratulate our local operators, SBST and SMRT on signing the Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with the NTWU to raise the competencies of their train and bus workers. This cooperation between company management and unions is critical to developing a future-ready workforce."
306,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Our businesses will also benefit. I agree with Mr Ang Wei Neng that developing local capabilities is vital to ensuring industry resilience. However, offset conditions, such as the transfer of technology, which are prohibited under our international obligations, are not the only way to achieve this."
307,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Many of our local companies are already partnering LTA on civil construction projects. Hock Lian Seng and Lum Chang Building Contractors are two such companies which initially partnered other international contractors and made use of these opportunities to grow their experience and capabilities. Today, they take on complex rail and road infrastructure projects on their own. Our procurement process must continue to be open and fair, so that more such opportunities are afforded to our local contractors."
308,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Our local companies gain from contracts with LTA. This gives them the experience they need to go beyond our shores and secure overseas work. ST Electronics is one such example. They started growing their rail capabilities by performing works for the North-South and East-West Lines in the 1980s. And now they go on to secure contracts overseas, and are a major supplier of Passenger Information Systems for railways in several countries."
309,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Looking ahead, there will be more such opportunities and we look forward to the continued involvement of local businesses."
310,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Chairman, we are committed to building a world-class land transport system for Singapore. LTMP 2040 is yet another step in this journey together with Singaporeans to build the kind of land transport system we want for ourselves and our future. It is not just about the shared space or being a social leveller that the public transport system is. It is not simply about building the roads or buying the buses or the trains, or building new types of land transport systems. It is about bringing Singapore together. Thank you, Sir."
311,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Order. I propose to take a break now.
312,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the House.
313,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Speaker,Mr Speaker: Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 3.35 pm.
314,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),, Sitting accordingly suspended
315,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),, at 3.13 pm until 3.35 pm.
316,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Sitting resumed at 3.35 pm.
317,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),[Mr Speaker in the Chair],[Mr Speaker in the Chair]
318,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.
319,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),[Mr Speaker in the Chair],[Mr Speaker in the Chair]
320,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Head W (cont) –
321,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten): Sir, last September, the Land Transport (Enforcement Measures) Bill was passed in Parliament. During the debate, several Members shared about the frustrations of pedestrians when they encounter irresponsible riders. Stories were told about pedestrians who were injured by reckless riders of Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs) or cyclists and about the elderly or young children who had close shaves with these riders. "
322,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,MOT had also said that they would accept all the recommendations of the Active Mobility Advisory Panel for safer path riding and will implement these recommendations in early 2019.
323,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Notwithstanding the various measures taken by LTA enforcement officers, I still receive many complaints about reckless and dangerous behaviour of cyclists and users of PMDs. Sadly, many cyclists still behave irresponsibly even though they are cycling in areas where there are many pedestrians, some of whom are elderly and some of whom are young children. "
324,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The most challenging area is where there are food delivery companies. In the areas surrounding the food delivery companies, the PMD riders and the cyclists ride in a reckless and unsafe manner as they rush to deliver their food to the customers."
325,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"May I ask Minister for an update as to how we can better educate the riders and cyclists to be considerate for other users of footpaths and the roads. The Ride Safe lessons conducted currently only reach out to those riders who are converted and who are convinced about the need for safety. For those who do not care about safety or the need to be considerate to other road users, they do not bother to attend such safety lessons."
326,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Sir, how can we reach these people to educate them on the need to be safe and the need to be considerate? Will there be a step-up in enforcement against reckless and inconsiderate riders?"
327,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"LTA says that the recommendations of the Active Mobility Advisory Panel will be implemented on 1 February 2019. How will this be done? For example, the speed limit for PMDs and bicycles on footpaths had been reduced to 10 km/h. Sir, this is slower than a jogger taking a leisurely jog. How can an enforcement officer determine the speed of the PMD or bicycle? How about the mandatory use of helmets by cyclists on roads? Will the cyclist riding along a small road from his home to the bus stop or to the market be summoned if he does not put on a helmet? Would these rules also apply to the foreign workers riding from their dormitory to their work place? "
328,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I urge the Minister to expedite the steps to ensure that all road users, including pedestrians, PMD users and cyclists can have a safer journey when using footpaths and the roads."
329,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon): Sir, in 2018, the Minister revealed that the accidents involving PMDs, bicycles and power-assisted bikes increased three-fold in 2017. Can the Minister share some updated statistics for 2018? How many such accidents were serious enough that someone was sent to hospital? "
330,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I understand the Active Mobility Advisory Panel’s preference to prioritise reduction of accidents. But accidents will happen, and some of them will be so serious that they require large hefty medical fees. Without insurance, the perpetrator or victim will have trouble paying off these fees. It is a double blow when the accident victim rides as part of his work and he can no longer do so because he is injured, or his vehicle is damaged. "
331,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"For a start, perhaps let us make it mandatory for all employers who rely on their employees to use PMDs for work purposes. The Government can work with insurance companies to help companies get a more affordable deal. "
332,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Compulsory registration of e-scooters will make it easy to implement mandatory insurance. I know most e-scooters will not get into accidents. But the same can be said for car drivers, and motor insurance is still mandatory. And just like for cars, we need constant enforcement to make sure people stay within the rules. Residents have been giving feedback that, during morning peak hours, there are a lot of PMDs, e-scooters, bicycles zooming along covered linkways leading to the MRT station. This is very dangerous for pedestrians. Can the Minister share how much LTA has stepped up enforcement, and how LTA decides how much enforcement they should do?"
333,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Next, to prevent unnecessary accidents in housing estates, it would be prudent to ban bicycles and PMDs at areas which are crowded or known to be accident-prone. The best organisation to do so would be the Town Council, which receives a lot of feedback on such issues. Can LTA consider giving Town Councils the power to decide where cycling and PMD riding should be banned for the safety of residents, especially young children and the elderly."
334,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Last, but not least, I wish my favourite Minister a speedy recovery."
335,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member): Thank you, Mr Chairman. I certainly agree with comments of the hon Mr Lim Biow Chuan which he just delivered. Mr Chairman, last November, I asked the Government to consider delaying the introduction of commercial shared PMD services until the riding culture for PMDs has improved and incidences of unsafe and inconsiderate usage have subsided. Sadly, my request was turned down. "
336,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"However, even before my Parliamentary Question (PQ) was answered, prospective operator Beam announced in October that it planned to roll out its shared PMD services within the next few weeks. LTA had to issue a statement reminding all that it is an offence to operate a device-sharing service at public places without licence. In replying to my PQ, Senior Minister of State Lam Pin Min also said that the licence application exercise would only take place in January this year. "
337,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"In December 2018, I chanced upon a few PMDs with the familiar green logo of Grab displayed and parked outside a shophouse along Jalan Sultan. I was surprised to see this, given the answer to my PQ just a month before. I enquired with LTA and LTA confirmed that Grab was not allowed to operate on public land without a licence from LTA and they said they were investigating operators who were operating without a licence. I have also seen PMDs belonging to other operators being used on public lands. The fact that these operators have been operating their PMDs in public without a licence is disconcerting. If operators behave in this way without a proper licence, how can we have confidence in such companies toeing the line after they receive a licence? We should also remember Grab’s reaction to the Competition Commission’s findings on its acquisition of Uber."
338,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"In his reply to my PQ, Senior Minister of State Lam Pin Min set out some of the conditions which would be imposed on the shared PMD operators upon issuance of their licence. I agree with those conditions but, notwithstanding these conditions, my reservations regarding the introduction of commercial shared PMD services have remained. It has been difficult enough to ensure that all PMD owners adhere to new rules for safe use of PMDs and to be considerate to other footpath users. We are not out of the woods yet. Would it not exacerbate the present situation if we have a new category of users, namely hirers? Hirers are likely to take less ownership of the need to ride responsibly and considerately as compared to owners since they are not the owners."
339,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Even if conditions are imposed on the operators, there is a limit as to what operators can do to ensure that correct use of PMDs is adopted by all users. While it is good to require operators to have insurance for all users, which may be helpful when there is an accident leading to a personal injury or property damage claim, this does not stop inconsiderate or unlawful behavior and, certainly, near misses. "
340,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The biggest challenge is still of getting existing PMD owners and users to use the PMDs in accordance with the law and in a safe and considerate manner. What more can we expect from hitherto non-PMD users, namely, hirers? Already, I have seen quite a number of tourists or overseas visitors on the illegally operated PMDs, some of them even riding on the roads. What does LTA expect the operators to do to ensure that users will ride considerately and according to the regulations? Make them mug up all the rules before scooting off? "
341,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs and National Development (Ms Sun Xueling),"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs and National Development (Ms Sun Xueling): Mr Chairman, the Land Transport Masterplan 2040 vision of a car-lite Singapore is an ambitious and enticing one."
342,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"To achieve these ambitious targets not only require new infrastructure but also changes in lifestyle and commuting habits. To these ends, I would like to inquire how we are progressing in expanding pedestrian walkways to accommodate pedestrians and PMD users. And since the implementation of active mobility rules on 1 February 2019, how has enforcement kept up to ensure that PMD users are safety conscious and responsible users of public paths?"
343,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Education is also an important part of equation. How are we working with the community to disseminate good and safe etiquette on shared paths?
344,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Next, there has been an increase in the number of fires involving PMDs. There was 74 such fires last year, a 51% increase from the 49 cases in 2017. What guidelines are in place for PMDs and how do we ensure that the current stock of PMDs in the market are safe for PMD users and the community around them?"
345,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Miss Cheng Li Hui,"Miss Cheng Li Hui: Mr Chairman, the licence application period for PMD sharing services has just ended earlier this month. Having learnt from the experience of oBike which left many users wondering if they could get their deposits back, I would like to ask Minister if PMD sharing operators will require users to put up deposits. And if so, how will the Ministry be requiring that these operators place a security deposit or performance bond?"
346,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"In addition, the usage of PMDs in the hands of the young and inexperienced riders can be potentially hazardous to both the path users and themselves. Therefore, I would like to ask Minister if there will be a mandatory age requirement for users to operate PMDs as age can be a form of indication on users' abilities to comprehend rules and operate PMDs safely."
347,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Yee Chia Hsing,"Mr Yee Chia Hsing: Chairman, it is important that we ensure that our land transport system is accessible to seniors, families with young children and the disabled."
348,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"In January this year, I filed a Parliamentary Question (PQ) on whether ""reserved seats"" on MRT trains can be better regulated and enforced as many able-bodied passengers who take up these seats are not giving up the seats to others who may need the seats more. Some are ""sleeping"" and then miraculously know how to wake up when the train reaches their destination."
349,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I also observed that there are two different designs for the reserved seats. One design just make it clear these are reserved seats with prominent ""Reserved Seating"" stickers being pasted on the seats themselves as well as above the seats. Another design is based on softer approach with a ""StandUpStacey Show You Care"" sticker above the seat but nothing is pasted on the seat itself."
350,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,I would like to ask if the Ministry has done a study as to which design is more effective in ensuring that able-bodied commuters do not take the reserved seats.
351,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Can the Ministry also share what measures are being taken to ensure that our land transport system remains accessible to seniors, families with young children and the disabled, in particular, measures to promote a more caring commuter culture?"
352,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Dr Lam Pin Min.
353,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Lam Pin Min,"Dr Lam Pin Min: Mr Chairman, Senior Minister of State Janil touched on the infrastructure improvements we have implemented to improve public transport and point-to-point connectivity. My speech will focus on making active mobility viable for shorter journeys and first-and-last-mile connections to transport nodes, while allowing Singaporeans to meet their aspirations for healthy living."
354,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"During the recent public engagements for LTMP 2040, some participants I spoke to mentioned that they use their daily commute to squeeze in a little bit of exercise by walking and cycling. They wanted to see more options for walking and cycling between destinations. Others expressed hopes for safer path-sharing and more harmonious interactions between path users."
355,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We support these aspirations by Singaporeans, and will enhance our transport system to facilitate active and healthy lifestyles and to ensure safety for all."
356,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"To help more Singaporeans embrace active mobility, we will continue to enhance active mobility accessibility, while inculcating a safe and gracious path-sharing culture to address pedestrians' concerns with path-sharing."
357,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"First, we are expanding active mobility options through building more cycling infrastructure. By 2030, Singapore will have a comprehensive network of off-road cycling paths in every HDB town. In addition to the existing 120 km of cycling paths it has built, LTA is constructing cycling paths in Bukit Panjang and Bishan, and expanding the cycling network in Ang Mo Kio and Tampines over the next three years. LTA will also build the Geylang-City and Queenstown-City inter-town cycling routes. When completed in 2020, they will connect cyclists and Personal Mobility Device (PMD) users directly from their homes to the city."
358,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"With the increased popularity of active mobility, Singaporeans have expressed concerns about safety on paths shared by pedestrians and PMD users. These are valid concerns. As Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Ms Sun Xueling have pointed out, active mobility accidents have increased due to the increased use of bicycles and PMDs. The number of reported off-road accidents involving active mobility users increased from 132 in 2017 to 251 in 2018."
359,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"To stem this worrying trend, the Active Mobility Advisory Panel (AMAP) conducted a review of active mobility rules in 2018. The Government has since accepted their recommendations."
360,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"In January, we started the registration regime for e-scooters to deter reckless riding behaviour and facilitate enforcement efforts in tracking down errant riders. To date, over 40,000 e-scooters have been registered."
361,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We also reduced the speed limit on footpaths from 15 km/h to 10 km/h in February this year. To address Mr Lim Biow Chuan's query, a slower speed gives active mobility users and pedestrians more time to react to unforeseen circumstances, and reduces the risk of severe injuries should accidents occur."
362,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Last year, the AMAP recommended against mandating third-party liability insurance so as to accommodate the diversity of active mobility device users and keep active mobility affordable. Nonetheless, we echo Er Dr Lee Bee Wah's sentiments on the importance of third-party liability insurance, and strongly encourage users to insure themselves against third-party claims."
363,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"To this end, LTA and AMAP have engaged the insurance industry and employers of large groups of active mobility users, such as food delivery companies, to spur the provision of insurance coverage. Similarly, we will require PMD-sharing licensees to procure and maintain third-party liability insurance."
364,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah also asked that Town Councils be allowed to ban bicycles and PMDs for pedestrian safety. The Active Mobility Act allows pedestrians, cyclists and PMD users to use footpaths as they are crucial for connectivity. It is important that the same rules are applied consistently to all footpaths so that users will not be confused with different rules at different areas."
365,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I thank Miss Cheng Li Hui for her suggestions to improve active mobility safety. We will continue to review our regulations to ensure safety of all path users, and will take the suggestions into account for the next review."
366,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"To safeguard pedestrian safety, we will consider infrastructural improvements where necessary, such as pedestrian priority zones which employ ""SLOW"" markings, speed regulating strips and signages to alert cyclists and riders to slow down and look out for pedestrians."
367,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I fully agree with Miss Cheng Li Hui, Ms Sun Xueling, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Lim Biow Chuan on the need for stronger enforcement to deter reckless riding behaviour. Indeed, we have stepped up enforcement actions. LTA's team of Active Mobility Enforcement Officers has been carrying out regular checks at hotspots, using speed guns and weighing scales to enforce speed limit and device weight requirements."
368,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Since May 2018, LTA has detected more than 3,100 active mobility offences, which include unsafe riding on paths and riding of non-compliant devices."
369,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"To complement its existing enforcement efforts, LTA will implement a trial later this year to place closed-circuit televisions at hotspots for better detection of active mobility offences."
370,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"However, enforcement alone is not enough. As Mr Lim Biow Chuan has rightly pointed out, we also need to educate users on responsible behaviour."
371,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We have pressed on with the Safe Riding Programme (SRP), which educates active mobility device users on safe riding practices and proper use of active mobility infrastructure. In its first year, 39,000 participants from schools, companies and community completed the programme. We will continue to offer the programme at a fully subsidised rate until the end of 2019, so that more will be able to participate."
372,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"LTA has also worked with the Ministry of Manpower and Traffic Police to issue a joint circular to food delivery companies to encourage food delivery riders to ride safely, and provide avenues for members of the public to report unsafe riding."
373,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I also agree with Ms Sun Xueling on the need to introduce guidelines to improve the safety of PMDs and reduce fire risks. As I have previously shared in this House, we will prohibit the sale of non-UL2272 certified PMDs from 1 July 2019 to reduce the risk of PMD fire incidents. We have strongly advised PMD users to purchase PMDs from reputable sources, observe fire safety standards and avoid overcharging PMD batteries or modifying their PMDs."
374,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I would like to assure Ms Sun Xueling that today, footpaths in new public estates are about 1.8 metres wide and most footpaths in public estates are at least 1.5 metres wide. We will expand footpaths where feasible. However, there are some places where this is not possible. We will therefore need to strive for an ethos of gracious path-sharing where cyclists, PMD users and pedestrians look out for each other's safety."
375,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Ground-up initiatives, such as the Active Mobility Patrol (AMP) scheme, will play a crucial role in harnessing the community to promote harmonious path-sharing behaviour. We now have more than 1,000 volunteers conducting patrols and organising outreach activities in their communities to educate cyclists and PMD users on how they should adjust their behaviour to accommodate the needs of fellow path-users."
376,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"In recent years, operators offering active mobility device-sharing services have emerged. This is a new, growing sector – while it offers Singaporeans better access to active mobility devices at cheap prices, it also comes with its own share of challenges."
377,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Last year, we introduced a licensing regime for bicycle-sharing operators. The regime regulates the maximum fleet size for each licensee based on responsible operator behaviour, and aligns fleet growth with parking provisions and consumer needs. In January this year, we introduced measures to ensure that users park responsibly, such as the QR code parking system, and requiring operators to ban recalcitrant users from device-sharing services."
378,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We have stepped up the provision of bicycle parking spaces by implementing yellow boxes, especially in areas of high demand for bicycle parking. We now have more than 220,000 bicycle parking lots islandwide, with all public housing located within a five-minute walk from a public bicycle parking facility. We target to provide a total of 267,000 lots by 2020."
379,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"With these efforts, we have made great strides in bringing the indiscriminate parking situation under control. The number of shared bicycle trips ending outside a designated parking location has been declining steadily, and we will continue to work with operators to reduce indiscriminate parking."
380,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked about what we learnt from the oBike incident. oBike's sudden exit preceded our licensing regime, and deeply inconvenienced many Singaporeans."
381,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The licensing regime will help to address some of the disamenities caused by oBike's exit. For example, when oBike exited, it was difficult to locate the individual bicycles left behind which did not have location-tracking features. Under our licensing regime, licensees are required to install location tracking devices on their bicycles, and prepare plans to remove their bicycles in a timely manner should they exit the market."
382,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I would like to assure Mr Yee Chia Hsing that under our licensing regime, responsible device-sharing operators will have the flexibility to grow their fleet sizes. This year, we opened a second round of licence applications for bicycle-sharing services on 4 January. This allows new operators to enter the market and gives responsible licensees that are able to manage their fleets effectively the opportunity to grow their fleets."
383,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Miss Cheng Li Hui asked if PMD-sharing licensees will require users to put up deposits. Based on the licence applications we have received, no PMD-sharing licence applicant intends to require user deposits. "
384,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Mr Dennis Tan and Miss Cheng Li Hui expressed concern over the operations of PMD-sharing services, and the impact of allowing PMD-sharing services at this time. I would like to assure them that we will proceed cautiously. LTA is assessing the first batch of PMD-sharing licence applications and will only license operators who are capable of managing indiscriminate parking and complying with fire safety requirements, and have clear plans to educate users on proper parking, safe riding and fire safety. We will start conservatively, with new operators restricted to small fleet sizes of up to 500 PMDs under a one-year sandbox licence period. This gives LTA time to assess sandbox licensees’ ability to comply with regulatory requirements, before granting them a larger fleet size under a full licence. LTA may revoke the licence of non-compliant sandbox licensees during the licence period. "
385,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," PMD-sharing licensees will be subjected to PMD-specific safety requirements. These include ensuring that shared PMDs are charged only by suitable personnel in proper environments, and requiring shared PMDs to be certified to the UL2272 standard. PMD-sharing licensees will also be required to procure and maintain third-party liability insurance, and to have identification stickers and tracking devices installed on devices to facilitate enforcement. I am confident that our licensing approach and regulatory requirements will allow us to start on the right footing for PMD-sharing services.  "
386,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Mr Chairman, we will continue to support Singaporeans’ aspirations for healthier lifestyles and safer journeys. As active mobility becomes more popular, we will continue to promote a safe path-sharing culture and ensure that device-sharing operators provide their services in a safe and responsible manner."
387,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Mr Baey Yam Keng.
388,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng),"The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng): Mr Chairman, during the Land Transport Master Plan 2040 public engagement, many Singaporeans came forward to share their aspirations and concerns."
389,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,We hear you and we will plan for a future-ready land transport system.
390,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Yee Chia Hsing would be pleased to know that we are aspiring towards a more inclusive land transport system, which caters to the diverse mobility needs of all Singaporeans.  "
391,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,The LTMP Advisory Panel recommended three strategies to help us achieve this:
392,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"On the first strategy, to design an inclusive land transport infrastructure, all MRT stations and bus interchanges are already barrier-free. Last year, we completed a five-year programme to add 200 km of sheltered walkways to make walking to our public transport nodes more convenient and pleasant."
393,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Ms Low Yen Ling requested for sheltered walkways. LTA will continue to provide the same extent of sheltered walkway connectivity between all public transport nodes and developments, whenever new MRT lines or developments are built. With more than 60 new MRT stations underway, we expect another 100 km of sheltered walkway to be added by 2029. We must be careful in considering other locations to ensure that limited resources are focused on areas which can benefit more people."
394,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),, We will continue to do more for our seniors and take steps to enhance road safety for them.
395,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," In 2014, we introduced Silver Zones which featured narrower roads and speed humps to reduce traffic speed, and two-stage crossings to allow senior pedestrians to rest at the midpoint. We have completed 15 Silver Zones, and I am glad that accident rates in these areas have dropped by 75%. We are building another 20 Silver Zones by 2020 at areas, including Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, Potong Pasir Avenue 1 and Tampines Street 81. We are on track to achieve our target of 50 Silver Zones by 2023."
396,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," As LTA continues to work with the community on design of these identified locations, we are also adopting innovative solutions. In December 2018, LTA tested three-dimensional traffic calming markings along Whampoa Drive to slow down traffic. LTA has also installed LED road studs at zebra crossings to alert motorists of pedestrians at night. I urge all motorists to slow down and be even more alert to look out for pedestrians when approaching these areas. "
397,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Besides infrastructure enhancements, we also need to have a robust vehicle homologation regime. This refers to LTA’s process to ensure that new vehicle models meet all technical and safety requirements before they can be used on our roads. During last week’s Budget debate, Mr Ang Wei Neng said that the process takes eight weeks. I checked and I am glad to find that this is not correct. The average processing time taken by LTA was two weeks in 2018. Even if we include the time to clarify an incomplete application, the average total time taken was five weeks in 2018. The regime is aligned with internationally recognised standards, such as the UN Economic Commission for Europe Regulations. LTA will continue to engage industry stakeholders to streamline the process to reduce business costs, while ensuring safety. "
398,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," We will also make land transport more accessible for commuters with disabilities. We have committed to making all our public buses wheelchair accessible by 2020. Besides physical accessibility, we also want to make information such as service number and bus stop destination more accessible to commuters with special needs. "
399,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," In January 2019, LTA started a trial on Mobility Assistance for the Visually Impaired and Special Users (MAVIS) mobile app. This provides audio announcements both on the bus and at the bus stop to help bus commuters with special needs. The trial started with three buses on Service 139, which serves the Enabling Village. These three buses will subsequently be redeployed in May 2019 to Service 141, which serves the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped. This will help us to study the feasibility of such assistive technologies on more public bus services. "
400,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Next, let us look at families. Last year, the Government received recommendations from the Family Friendly Transport Advisory Panel. I am happy to announce that the Government accepts the Panel’s recommendations and we are already implementing some of the measures. For example, LTA started a one-year trial for the stroller restraint system on Service 69 in June 2017. We received positive feedback and will progressively install the system on all buses by 2020. "
401,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," LTA will be conducting a pilot on one rail line, to designate priority cabins for vulnerable commuters such as seniors, persons with disabilities and families with young children. These cabins will be located near the station lifts where possible. "
402,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Beyond mass public transport, we will also make point-to-point transport more accessible by designing all new taxi stands to be barrier-free. "
403,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Mr Chairman, our second strategy is to develop the capabilities of our public transport workers as they make important contributions. I agree with Mr Melvin Yong that a first class transport system needs a first-class transport workforce."
404,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Land transport workers work hard daily to bring millions of Singaporeans safely to their destinations and they also offer assistance regularly for those in need to make their journeys easier. Bus captains start their day as early as 4 am and rail technicians work throughout the night to carry out maintenance works. They are working while we are sleeping. We should appreciate and support them.
405,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The Public Transport Workers’ Appreciation Day was launched in 2017. Last year, the event was held at the Istana for the very first time. This emphasises the important contributions by our public transport workers. Beyond formal recognition, a simple ""hello"" or ""thank you"" or just a smile when we meet a transport worker, can brighten their days. We will continue to work with operators and unions to improve working conditions and training opportunities for our transport workers. New and upgraded bus depots and interchanges will have more comfortable staff canteens and lounges. The Singapore Bus Academy and the Singapore Rail Academy are also working with NTWU, industry partners and Voluntary Welfare Organisations to enhance training content to build capabilities of public transport workers to better serve commuters in need.  "
406,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Mr Chairman, an inclusive land transport system requires everyone to play their part. The Government will continue to invest in inclusive infrastructure. The public transport workers also play an important role to support more vulnerable commuters. Lastly, commuters must contribute in creating a safe community space, fostering positive social norms and a caring commuting culture. This is the third strategy recommended by the LTMP Advisory Panel. "
407,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," LTA began Graciousness Campaigns for public transport in 2009, to promote simple acts of thoughtful behaviour such as giving up seats and queueing. LTA has been progressively replacing the reserved seat stickers on trains with new stickers featuring the Thoughtful Character, Stand-Up Stacey. I thank Mr Yee Chia Hsing for his interest in our campaigns and their effectiveness. LTA’s perception study showed that the new stickers have helped to sustain interest in terms of commuters giving up their seats.  "
408,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),," Indeed, Singaporeans are willing to go the extra mile to help fellow commuters. At the Heart Zones at Jurong East, Novena and Outram Park MRT stations, the community readily come forward to help patients who need assistance to get to the nearby hospitals. Later this year, the Public Transport Council (PTC) will implement Heart Zone at Yishun MRT station, in partnership with Yishun Health. PTC aims to have Heart Zones at all MRT stations near every restructured hospital, for example Seng Kang and Simei. We want to encourage a culture where small caring gestures can make a difference. Some of my Parliamentary colleagues told me they are interested to offer needy residents credits to top up their fare cards, very much like how NTUC FairPrice vouchers are used to help them purchase daily necessities. We will look into this suggestion."
409,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Mr Chairman, please allow me a few more minutes to complete the last part of my speech in Mandarin."
410,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"(In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Building a safe and inclusive land transport system requires everyone − Government, transport workers and commuters – to play their part."
411,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Infrastructure and campaigns alone are not enough to build a more gracious society. For a sustained change in behaviour, we need commuters to look out for one another. I encourage Singaporeans to be positive influences to others in their daily lives. We can do so by caring for fellow commuters, pedestrians and transport workers when we use public transport, footpaths or roads. Put others before yourself, lend a hand to those who need help. For example, even if you are not on a ‘reserved seat’, you can still give up your seat to those who need it more than you do. When on the road, drive safely and look out for pedestrians. Slow down at all areas, not just at Silver Zones."
412,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Together, I believe we can create a safe and inclusive land transport system, where every journey can be more comfortable, heart-warming and pleasant."
413,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Lastly, I hope to encourage all of us towards this vision with this short poem:"
414,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,“Commuting in Singapore
415,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Moving together as one
416,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Without caring for others around you
417,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,It will be a difficult journey
418,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Show that you care
419,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,And we will all feel the warmth  
420,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Be it driving, riding or walking"
421,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,We can all be safe and happy!”
422,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Clarifications. Mr Ang Wei Neng.
423,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Mr Ang Wei Neng: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I have clarifications for Senior Minister of State Janil and for Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey. During my cut on the ""20-minute Town and 40-minute City"", I have asked how many households today are staying within a 10-minute walk to an MRT station and how many current trips today to city are taking less than 45 minutes, so that we can have a benchmark as compared to our Vision in 2040. I hope Senior Minister of State also can enlighten us whether MOT has given up hope to persuade Government agencies and companies to have staggered working hours so as to smoothen out the traffic during the peak hours."
424,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"For Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey, I am glad that LTA has made the clarification on homologations but this is only one example that I quoted for agencies to look at how to cut red tape. I hope LTA is not being defensive. In fact, the experience on the ground is actually quite different."
425,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Dr Janil Puthucheary: Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Ang Wei Neng for the question. He asked how many households are within a 10-minute walk to an MRT station today and the proportion today stands at 64%; 64% of households are within a 10-minute walk. And then how many current trips to the city take less than 45 minutes. So, if someone stays within 800 metres of a train station, 10-minute walk, three-quarters of those peak period train-only journeys are completed within 45 minutes. But if you are looking at all peak hour public journeys today, only 55% are completed within 45 minutes."
426,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The second point he asked about staggered working hours, yes, LTA and MOT, we will try our best to encourage people to adopt staggered working hours. It will be another strategy to help smoothen out the load and the demand of our public transport system."
427,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Baey Yam Keng: In response to his speech last week, perhaps he was just quoting the specific example, but LTA is committed to streamline homologation regulations and not just that, but also in all processes so that we can provide better services to the public."
428,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Ms Low Yeng Ling.
429,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Ms Low Yen Ling,"Ms Low Yen Ling: Mr Chairman, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Senior Minister of State Janil, in particular, Minister Khaw Boon Wan and as well as to MOT, LTA for the good news of Hume MRT station. Throughout the years, Minister Khaw and his team have been very patient in listening to our transport requests and we are really very grateful for this good news. In Gombak, in Hillview, in Hume, we stand ready to work with LTA and MOT with regards to the building of the Hume MRT station."
430,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Throughout the years, Minister Khaw and his team have been very patient in listening to our transport requests and we are very grateful for this good news. In Gombak, in Hillview and in Hume, we stand ready towards the LTA and MOT with regard to the building of the Hume MRT station."
431,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I have one clarification for Senior Minister of State Dr Janil: is there a chance that the Hume MRT station can be completed before 2025, please?"
432,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Dr Janil Puthucheary: Mr Chairman, I thank Mayor Ms Low Yen Ling for the question. We are in this position today because Mayor Low and her grassroots leaders have worked hard with our agencies, as well as the MND and various agencies, to look into how development can be brought into that area and new facilities can be created, and new opportunities can begin, as a result of which we can now justify the ridership for Hume MRT station going forward."
433,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"So, we do need some time to pass for the developments, justifying the opening of Hume MRT station to occur. On top of that, it is not just that we have to open Hume station, but we have to build Hume station, and that would take some time. There is going to be architectural works, earthworks, ventilation shafts, and we have to do so together with the other developments around the area so that we do not obstruct some of the new things that are coming up. So, we will try our best, but I am pleased to repeat that we will be opening Hume station by 2025."
434,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Dr Teo Ho Pin
435,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Teo Ho Pin,"Dr Teo Ho Pin: Sir, I would like to make a clarification with Senior Minister of State Dr Lam Pin Min regarding the proposed cycling path in Bukit Panjang Town. When is the cycling path going to be completed? Is the cycling path going to be a separate stand-alone cycling path away from the existing footpaths."
436,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Lam Pin Min,"Dr Lam Pin Min: Mr Chairman, I just want to thank Dr Teo Ho Pin for that clarification. The cycling path for Bukit Panjang area is targeted to be completed sometime in 2021. This will be a stand-alone cycling path which is separate from the existing footpaths."
437,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Mr Arasu Duraisamy
438,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Arasu Duraisamy,"Mr Arasu Duraisamy: I have a question for Senior Minister of State Dr Janil. I thank Senior Minister of State Dr Janil for his reply to my cut. In his reply he mentioned that since the Tuas South station would still be in its development phase and the anticipated ridership would be low, could he then explain to me what is the rationale when we are about to spend a quarter of a million dollars to build the Founders Memorial station and there are no projected numbers on that particular station – I mean foot traffic."
439,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"What is the development process that is going to go around that particular station? His reply was that Tuas South station would still be in the development phase, I anticipate that Founders Memorial station would also still be in the development phase – they are both in that particularly. But you have also earlier projected to build a station there. So, could you then explain to me the rationale why you cannot look at a line down to Tuas South."
440,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Dr Janil Puthucheary: So, Mr Chairman, I think it is not that everything has to be developed before we bring in an MRT line or a transport service, but it is the confidence around the ridership. So there is no single development or facility that will say this is the right thing to do or this is the wrong thing to do – we have to look at the total expected demand. For Tuas South, yes, in the long term, there may be a very different demand picture from what we expect today. But on the basis of what we are currently projecting, it is not something that we can justify at this point in time in the medium term."
441,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Mr Ang Hin Kee.
442,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Ang Hin Kee,"Mr Ang Hin Kee: Sir, I have two clarifications. One is for Senior Minister of State Dr Lam, on air transport. I notice that we are making a lot of effort to have air agreements in order for us to have more air traffic. I would like to find out whether or not the MOT's mitigation measures for residents around the Seletar Airport site with regard to how noise from increased air traffic can be mitigated; and are those mitigation measures effective?"
443,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The second clarification is for Senior Minister of State Dr Janil. Thank you very much for agreeing to set up the tripartite committee for private hire drivers and with the industry. I am just wondering whether LTA or MOT sides will assist the industry to form an association because, right now, the operators are all individuals. So, when they come for the meetings, they come as an individual, rather than a collective association. So sometimes, the voices can be very disparate and they do not quite have a common position on whether the industry operators want to bring to the table to negotiate."
444,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"And finally, I would like to know his views on whether or not setting a high age limit for private hire drivers moving forward is a measure in the right direction?"
445,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Lam Pin Min,"Dr Lam Pin Min: Mr Chairman, I would like to thank Mr Ang for his clarification. In fact, we have received similar feedback from Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, and I do empathise with the disamenities with regard to noise pollution for residents who are staying in the vicinity of Seletar Airport. CAAS is mindful of the noise generated by overflying aircraft and we have been reviewing and adopting best practices in noise abatement measures according to international standards. To the extent possible, CAAS will direct aircraft to land from and take off towards directions to minimise flying over residential areas. This will, hopefully, reduce the amount of noise disturbances. "
446,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"However, for safety reasons, aircraft need to land and take off into the wind and depending on the prevailing wind conditions, it is sometimes unavoidable for aircraft to overfly residential areas, especially those in the Yishun and Yio Chu Kang areas."
447,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"At the same time, CAAS also disallows older jet aircraft that do not meet international standards on aircraft noise certification from flying into Singapore. Jet aircraft which operate to Seletar Airport are generally newer and quieter ones. Recently, based on some of the feedback from residents and from the grassroots organisations, we have since 1 January 2019 disallowed flights at Seletar Airport between 10.00 pm and 7.00 am every day, except for emergency and medical evacuation flights. This will hopefully reduce the amount of noise pollution in the evening and at night."
448,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Dr Janil.
449,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Dr Janil Puthucheary: Mr Chairman, I have to answer Mr Ang Hin Kee's question about the private hire vehicles drivers. In the first part, Mr Ang asked about the operators forming an association because the drivers are already part of the National Private Hire Vehicles Association."
450,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Well, certainly, we can engage with the operators and the business to do this. Potentially, we have a number of businesses that can get involved with the P2P space. Some would be traditional taxi companies and transport operators; some would be the very new mobility operators that we have seen coming to Singapore. But potentially, even tech companies could get into it. So, it is not a very clear industry as to who would be a partner. We will engage with them all, and if there is a need to form an association, I think we may have to look for some assistance to chair the committee and bso forth, but we will definitely be engaging Mr Ang to help us engage in this process."
451,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The age limit for the PDVL is something that has been raised in the feedback that we have had as part of the consultation process for the P2P regulatory framework. It is not something that we are clear about what the right thing to do is at this point in time. It is clear that there is a discrepancy in the age between the PDVL for PHC drivers and the TDVL for the taxi drivers. We will have to look and see what will be the reasonable thing to do. We will continue to engage with the industry, as well as the drivers, to see how to deal with this. It is something we are studying and we will come back to Mr Ang and the House when we are ready with more information."
452,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Mr Dennis Tan.
453,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong: I have four questions. The first question is for Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan. In the event of the withdrawal of air traffic services by Singapore over south Johor or the Riau Islands, may I ask the Minister what is his view on how it would affect Changi Airport as an air hub, as well as its future development?"
454,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"My second question goes to Senior Minister of State Dr Janil who said that the bus and taxi operators are committed to using cleaner technology by 2040, if I hear him correctly. So, may I ask the Senior Minister of State: since the bus and taxi operators are already so committed, is there really still a need to use diesel tax to, in the words of Minister Mr Heng Swee Keat, ""nudge these operators towards cleaner and more sustainable alternatives""?"
455,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"My third and fourth questions go to Senior Minister of State Dr Lam Pin Min. I thank the Senior Minister of State Lam for the answers to the shared PMD. My clarification is: will the errant behaviour of the customer hirers of the shared PMD operators be taken into account when the LTA assess the relevant operators complying with the sandbox licence conditions, or in respect of the specific hirers' eligibility to continue hiring e-scooters with any of the commercial operators."
456,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,My fourth question is also for Senior Minister of State Dr Lam and it is on maritime matters. I would be grateful if the Senior Minister of State can clarify: what is the status of the adoption of the 2012 amendments to the 1996 Protocol to the Convention of Limitation of Liability? When can we expect this to be introduced in our statutes?
457,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan.
458,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: I thank Mr Dennis Tan for that question. As I explained just now, I want to clearly differentiate between sovereignty and airspace, and the responsibility for the provision of air traffic services."
459,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"So, let us be very clear that we are not arguing about sovereignty. As I also explained earlier, there is a long history as to why and how Singapore provides these air traffic services."
460,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I have also emphasised that the main objective, regardless of who is performing, is the safety and efficiency of civil aviation. So, I think we are a long way from the hypothetical scenario which the Member has posited. But I would say this, Changi Airport is one of the world's busiest airport, and certainly in our immediately region, this is the focal point on which so many flights traversed. As I explained earlier on again, there are 740,000 flights which are receiving air traffic services from Singapore – half of those flights land or take off from Changi Airport."
461,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"So, our objectives in all our on-going discussions with our neighbours is to make sure that safety and efficiency is not compromised. The other salient factor is this: technology is also improving and it will help improve the throughput as well as maintain safety and efficiency."
462,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Again, I refer to my earlier speech when I talked about Distributed Multi-Nodal Air Traffic Flow management. I apologise; it has only been one week since I have been doing this. The concept behind multi-nodal air traffic flow management is that by interconnecting the air traffic control systems of all the airports in the region, it enables all the airports first, to continue to act autonomously, but to optimise the total flow and the throughput flying in and leaving from those airports."
463,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"That is why I have explained that CAAS is pioneering this technique and is doing so in an inclusive and open way. So, both Indonesia and Malaysia are participating with CAAS. The speed of which this can be implemented will have to vary according to comfort level, as well as to how familiar and how constructive and positive the relationship is."
464,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I would also draw reference to an earlier concept of a Seamless ASEAN sky. Again, the concept is that it is possible for win-win outcomes to be formulated using technology so long as we get the diplomacy and the foreign relations right. That is why we are focused on very intense, very delicate discussions and negotiations wit our counterparts. And I hope you also understand that not all of this can be made public. A lot of these discussions are best conducted quietly, behind closed doors."
465,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,Give CAAS and the authorities some more time.
466,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The bottomline is this. Changi Airport, air services and, in fact, the logistics, the air logistics, is a very significant sector for us economically. We must do our best to protect it, to nurture it and to promote it. But the point I also want to make to our neighbours is that this is an area where we can engage in win-win collaboration and not zero-sum games."
467,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Dr Janil.
468,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Dr Janil Puthucheary: Mr Chairman, Mr Dennis Tan asked about the need for diesel tax as a nudge towards achieving LTMP 2040 goals given that we in Government have committed to a clean public bus fleet and the taxi operators have already committed. The short answer is yes. I hope he agrees firstly that achieving a cleaner vehicular fleet is important for our personal health and the health of our city. That is not going to happen without some nudges and some economic incentives. So, we need regulatory structure in order to get there."
469,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"It is quite telling that despite the fact that we in Government have committed to an entirely clean public bus fleet by 2040 as have the taxi operators, not all the private-hire car operators have agreed. It is not an easy decision to make. There are some costs and some difficulties associated with that."
470,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Secondly, we need a solution today. We need to start moving in that direction today and not wait until 2040 to find out whether we are moving in the right direction or not, or whether we have gotten there. "
471,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Thirdly, diesel is not only used in taxis today. We have commercial vehicles, goods vehicles and private buses as well. And so, this is an important part of the vehicle population and we will have to persuade the owners, drivers and operators of these vehicles to move along with us on this journey towards a cleaner fleet by 2040. It is not going to happen just because we have asked it to happen. It has to make economic sense and some of that is going to have to include something like a change to the price of diesel which we recently introduced."
472,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Dr Lam.
473,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Lam Pin Min,"Dr Lam Pin Min: I would like to thank Mr Dennis Tan for the two clarifications. The first is on the criteria for selecting the PMD operators. In fact, LTA will consider each application on its own merits based the following criteria."
474,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"We will look at the company's track record. We look at whether they will be able to be compliant with the law and regulatory requirements, whether there are plans to educate users on safe riding behaviours, and, at the same time, we also look at the overall demands for shared services and the availability of parking spaces. But having said that, I think we also need to take errant riders to task. An individual will actually be penalised under the existing active mobility regulations. "
475,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"With regards to the Member's second question on the 1996 Limitation on Liability, I remember we had just passed the Merchants Shipping amendments only in January this year which was just two months ago. And MPA is currently looking at the implementation timeline with relevant agencies and we will update the Member as soon as we have the details."
476,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Mr Dennis Tan.
477,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Just a quick clarification with Senior Minister of State Dr Lam. Sorry if I did not make myself clear. My question on PMD is really on, will the errant behaviour of hirers be taken into account when the LTA assesses whether or not the relevant operator has complied with the licence operating conditions. That means, after the licence has been awarded, will the errant behaviour of their hirers be taken against them, so to speak? Also, in respect of their hirers' eligibility to continue to hire with any of the commercial operator? So, will errant behaviour, let us say if this rider has been caught riding on the road when he is not supposed to, will that actually be taken against him? Because if that is a case, then it will deter errant behaviour, just like what we see with shared bike."
478,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Lam Pin Min,"Dr Lam Pin Min: I would like to thank Mr Dennis Tan for the further clarification. Yes, it depends on the circumstance whereby the errant rider has gone against the active mobility regulations and requirements. But, of course, we look at the operator's efforts in educating users on safe riding behaviour and this will be taken into consideration. It will not be exactly fair to just penalise the operator if the operator has done its best to educate users with regards to safe riding behaviour. All PMD users, including users of shared-PMDs, will be penalised for flouting the active mobility regulations. Separately, for parking indiscriminately, we will impose a ban on users according to how often he breaks the rules."
479,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.
480,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah: Sir, I would like to thank MOT for banning flights into Seletar Airport from 10.00 pm to 7.00 am. I am sure my residents are monitoring the emergency flights."
481,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I have one question for Senior Minister State Dr Lam and my one question for Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng. For the crowded town centre areas like Khatib Centre, where residents have been giving feedback that there are a lot of near-missed accidents caused by reckless cycling, is LTA going to take enforcement action at locations like these and whether LTA has sufficient manpower to do enforcement action? And my next question is: is LTA open to allowing Town Councils to take on this role of taking enforcement action at town centres where there are potential hazards."
482,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"And my question to Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Baey is that, talking about approval timeframe by LTA, I am sure LTA officers are all working very hard, trying their very best, but is Senior Parliamentary Secretary open for dialogue sessions with architects and engineers to hear their side of the problems that they are facing, because I constantly receive feedback that the approval process is very long-drawn, one written direction after another written direction? Perhaps, you would like to have a dialogue session with the professionals."
483,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Lam Pin Min,"Dr Lam Pin Min: Mr Chairman, I just want to thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah on her supplementary questions. In fact, we have discussed this issue in previous parliamentary sittings. And we understand Er Dr Lee Bee Wah's concern with regard to the safety of pedestrians, especially her residents in her Town Council area. But I would also like to reiterate that the use of footpaths, including footpaths in Town Council areas are regulated under the Active Mobility Act. And the Active Mobility Act allows pedestrians, cyclists and PMD users to use such footpaths as they are crucial for connectivity. I think I have explained in my speech just now. It is also important for these same rules to be applied consistently to all footpaths so that users will not be confused with different rules at different areas. For example, you do allow a certain area in a certain Town Council to have no cycling zone, but allow cycling in other Town Councils, PMD users or cyclists may not be aware that it is not allowed and that will cause confusion."
484,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"LTA will continue to work with Town Council to assess the areas of concern and see whether we can have additional mitigating measures such as infrastructure works or better education and engagement efforts so that the safety concerns can be addressed. For example, if we know that there is a particular hotspot that may be prone to incidents, then we can have signages to warn PMD users, we can have signages to warn pedestrians. At the same time, we can also have CCTVs installed to enforce or to catch errant riders in those areas. LTA, together with MOT is committed to working with the Town Council of Er Dr Lee Wah and we can have joint education programmes as well as enforcement action to make sure that the hotspot that she is alluding to can be addressed in a timely manner."
485,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Baey Yam Keng: On Er Dr Lee Bee Wah's question, as a regulator, Government plays a role in meeting the needs of various stakeholders, including end consumers, users of public transport and the industry. "
486,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Public safety, the interests of public as well as business commercial interests will have to be balanced. Maybe I just like to ask Er Dr Lee Bee Wah when she talked about architects and engineers, is it any particular area under LTA's or any of our Statutory Boards' purview?"
487,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah: For any new project, architects and engineers will have to make plans submission, including LTA and BCA and many other Government agencies. So, when we talk about productivity, we hope that we can work together to see how best to expedite the approval rather than a lot of re-submissions that causes a lot of time delay."
488,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Baey Yam Keng: Okay. Sure. I believe Mr Chan Chun Sing, in his earlier speech, had talked about how the public service should adapt with changing times and technologies but at the same time, balancing the different needs of various stakeholders."
489,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Assoc Prof Walter Therseira.
490,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira: Sir, I seek a clarification from Senior Minister of State Dr Janil on the role of the PTC, please. Currently, I understand that it is limited by statue to just advising on a public rail, bus and taxi specifically. So, I seek his view on whether it is appropriate to include other P2P services for a start, but eventually, also active mobility services where balancing the interests of stakeholders and commuters is very important. And, if not, then what are the Ministry's plans for overseeing or advising on these emerging services in general?"
491,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Dr Janil Puthucheary: Mr Chairman, I thank Assoc Prof Walter Theseira for his suggestions. The PTC works closely together with LTA. So, when we are looking across the industry, we are working together – LTA as a regulator; the PTC looking out for fare affordability and the services to the citizens."
492,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"I think in the Member's earlier speech, he made comments about integrating services, for example. There are a number of aspects to integrating services. There is a regulatory component which LTA does take on, in terms of how we might integrate different aspects of our regulatory framework. And PTC will continue to look out for the interests of commuters in terms of the fares and fare affordability."
493,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"So, I do not know that necessarily, I would agree that we need to reconsider the role of PTC at this point in time. There is a working relationship that appears to be working quite well. Perhaps, as new models of public transport or as new models of P2P, business operations or integrated services come along, we will continue to study and try to find the right response. But I take his point that we need an integrated series of solutions to link the different modalities of transport together."
494,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,The Chairman: Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.
495,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin: Mr Chairman, there was a report in the Straits Times yesterday about NTU and Volvo launching an autonomous electric bus that is 12 metres long. I noted that Senior Minister of State Dr Janil has mentioned that AVs are still a long way away from our roads. But can I ask, does MOT have a rough timeline as to when such AVs can be on our roads?"
496,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Dr Janil Puthucheary: Indeed, Mr Chairman, we have a rough timeline. So, today, we have about 70 km of roads in One-North being used for on-road AV testings. So, it is in a ""live"" environment. Those vehicles, the operators that do that, have already pre-tested these in facilities like CETRAN at NTU, to establish the basic safety. The next phase, having established the on-road safety, is then to integrate these autonomous vehicles into ""live"" operations. We have committed to making that possible in three towns by 2023: Tengah, Jurong Innovation District and Punggol. What that would mean is we will have autonomous buses as a sort of 'live"" service, integrated with the other bus services that are available."
497,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The issue of autonomous cars – so there are two different types of autonomous vehicles – autonomous cars for private vehicle ownership, we do not have a timeline at the moment but we are actively engaging with the industry, we have made calls for proposals and we are working with a number of partners to establish what are the regulatory changes that we need, what is the local capability that we need. And perhaps, in the future Land Transport Master Plan, we might be able to announce something. But at the moment, we do not have a timeline for that."
498,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"So, clear timeline for revenue service for autonomous buses; at the moment, no timeline for autonomous cars."
499,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),The Chairman,"The Chairman: Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, would you like to withdraw your amendment, please?"
500,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),Mr Sitoh Yih Pin,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin: Chairman, I would like to thank all speakers and the entire MOT team for their hard work. With that, Mr Chairman, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment. Thank you."
501,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"Amendment, by leave, withdrawn."
502,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The sum of $2,033,424,400 for Head W ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates."
503,COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – HEAD W (MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT),,"The sum of $9,513,685,300 for Head W ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates."
