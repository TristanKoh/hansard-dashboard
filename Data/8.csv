0,PIPELINE OF SKILLED LOCAL CAR MECHANICS TO SUPPORT HYBRID/ELECTRIC AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES USING AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGY,Mr Ang Hin Kee,"4 Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport in view of the greater adoption of hybrid/electric and autonomous vehicles using automation technology (a) whether Singapore has enough skilled local car mechanics in the pipeline; (b) whether the Ministry will be mapping the skill requirements, job prospects, salary and career progression pathways to upskill our car mechanics; and (c) whether the major employers of car mechanics in Singapore have these initiatives in place."
1,PIPELINE OF SKILLED LOCAL CAR MECHANICS TO SUPPORT HYBRID/ELECTRIC AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES USING AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGY,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are about 15,000 car mechanics in the motor workshop industry. The Singapore Motor Workshop Association (SMWA) is leading industry efforts to upskill car mechanics in view of the greater adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles. SMWA is planning to establish a training academy which will offer centralised skills training for mechanics. This will ensure that car mechanics in Singapore continue to have relevant skills in light of changing technologies."
2,PIPELINE OF SKILLED LOCAL CAR MECHANICS TO SUPPORT HYBRID/ELECTRIC AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES USING AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGY,," SMWA is also planning to enhance local EV diagnostic, repair and maintenance capabilities. This will be achieved through hosting German specialists to train local mechanics, and organising overseas attachment programmes for more advanced training. Workforce Singapore will be providing funding support for this initiative under the Capability Transfer Programme."
3,PIPELINE OF SKILLED LOCAL CAR MECHANICS TO SUPPORT HYBRID/ELECTRIC AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES USING AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGY,," Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology is nascent and mainstream adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is still some time away. In the meantime, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is conducting trials to better understand AV technology and determine the eventual concept of operations for deployment in Singapore. These trials will provide a sense of the scale and type of repair and maintenance services required to inform our longer-term manpower development plans."
